      "game": "Miami Dolphins @ Buffalo Bills",
      "summary": "Unders lead this Dolphins–Bills board in multiple areas—particularly first/last TD, pass TDs (8 overs vs 24 unders), longest reception, and a slight lean on rushing yards—while anytime-TD overs are the main counter-signal. The standout player angle is James Cook, with the strongest edges on the board pointing to his rushing yards and rushing attempts unders. Receiving markets are tilted under as well (receptions 52/78 overs/unders; receiving yards 62/76), which aligns with a conservative stance on volume-driven pass outcomes. With a few balanced categories and mixed TD reads, treat this as a medium-uncertainty spot and keep stakes modest."

      "game": "Atlanta Falcons @ Carolina Panthers",
      "summary": "RB/WR “longest” and touchdown props skew heavily to the under here, with 20 unders flagged on both reception_longest and rush_longest and TD markets tilted under (anytime TD 8 unders to 1 over, first TD 10 unders, last TD 6 unders), suggesting a game short on explosive plays and scores. Bijan Robinson drives the top edges: his anytime TD under shows a large advantage (~−4562 bps), and his rushing yards market shows the biggest absolute swings (both a sizable under at ~−5155 bps and an over at ~+4458 bps depending on number). That split underscores higher uncertainty on his rushing volume/efficiency—keep stakes modest there and lean into the more consensus under angles on TDs and “longest” props. If you do play Bijan’s rushing yards, line/price sensitivity looks high, so shop carefully; otherwise broad market consistency lessens the need."

      "game": "Cincinnati Bengals @ Minnesota Vikings",
      "summary": "The model shows a strong lean to first- and last-touchdown unders (24 unders each), while anytime TDs tilt modestly to the over (14 overs vs 9 unders) and pass-TD props carry only a slight under bias. The clearest player value is on anytime TD overs for Justin Jefferson (~2,439 bps edge) and Bengals RB Chase Brown (~3,343 bps), aligning with the overall anytime-TD skew. Given the lack of a published confidence range and the split between scorer timing (unders) and anytime markets (overs), uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest."

      "game": "Green Bay Packers @ Cleveland Browns",
      "summary": "TD-scorer unders dominate this matchup: anytime TD signals skew 7 unders to 2 overs, with first TD unders 10 and last TD unders 6. That points to fading marginal anytime TD candidates and even keeping “No Scorer” in consideration at longer prices, which shows a positive edge (1867 bps) in the feed. Ignore the spurious Josh Jacobs anytime-TD entries as irrelevant to Packers–Browns, but the overall TD-scorer market still leans under. Pass-TD props are balanced (overs 2, unders 2), implying a fairly tight range on Jordan Love and Deshaun Watson, so uncertainty is higher there—keep stakes modest."

    {
      "game": "Houston Texans @ Jacksonville Jaguars",
      "summary": "TD-scorer unders dominate in Texans–Jaguars: the market-direction summary shows anytime TD unders 6 vs 1 over, plus unders across first-TD (7) and last-TD (3). The clearest fade is Nico Collins to score anytime (−2788 bps edge toward the under), and the model even finds meaningful value on “No Scorer” in the anytime pool (+1867 bps), implying a suppressed touchdown environment. With first/last TD markets broadly leaned to “no” outcomes, this profiles as a spot to sell popular scorer tickets rather than chase TD overs. Confidence granularity is limited (no 5th–95th range provided), so keep stake sizes modest."

      "game": "Las Vegas Raiders @ Washington Commanders",
      "summary": "TD-scorer unders dominate in Raiders–Commanders, with the model showing 8 unders to 1 over on anytime TDs, plus 10 and 6 unders on first- and last-TD, and a lean to pass-TD unders. The largest edges are concentrated in anytime TD fades for Jacory Croskey-Merritt (≈-3026 and -2909 bps across listings) and Ashton Jeanty (≈-3026 bps), indicating materially overpriced scorer odds. With no confidence range provided, treat this as a higher-uncertainty spot and keep stakes modest."

      "game": "Pittsburgh Steelers @ New England Patriots",
      "summary": "For Steelers at Patriots, touchdown-related unders dominate: anytime TD props skew 1 over vs 7 unders, with first TD unders 9 and last TD unders 5, plus pass TDs unders 4—suggesting a touchdown-scarce script. Explosive-play markets align, with reception_longest unders 4 and rush_longest unders 4, while receptions, receiving yards, rush attempts, and rush yards are mixed (1 over, 1 under each). The biggest individual signals are messy, centered on TreVeyon Henderson with directly conflicting recv_yds edges (-3792 bps and 3099 bps) and a sizable under on rush_attempts (-3092 bps), which tempers conviction on player-volume props. Net: prioritize TD and longest-play unders, but keep stakes modest given the mixed and contradictory player-level reads."

    {
      "game": "New York Jets @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
      "summary": "RB TD-scorer unders dominate this matchup: the model leans to unders in anytime TD (16 unders vs 8 overs) and is even stronger on first and last TD markets (25 and 21 unders, respectively). The biggest single-player fades are Bucky Irving anytime TD (-3941 bps) and Breece Hall anytime TD (-2043 bps), aligning with the broader under trend. This points to a strategy of targeting unders across TD-scorer props, particularly at RB. Uncertainty is higher with no confidence range provided, so keep stakes modest."

      "game": "Indianapolis Colts @ Tennessee Titans",
      "summary": "Unders dominate across TD-scoring and explosive-play markets: anytime TD unders 8 vs 1 over, first TD unders 10, last TD unders 6, and reception-longest unders 20. The clearest player angle is Jonathan Taylor rush yards under, the top edge on the board at roughly -5,346 to -5,153 bps versus market. Yardage markets are otherwise mixed (rush yards 4 overs/4 unders; pass yards 2/2; receiving yards 9 overs/13 unders), so confidence is higher on TD/longest-reception unders than broad yardage plays. Given that distribution, prioritize Taylor’s rush-yds under and the TD/longest-reception unders, keeping stakes modest elsewhere."

      "game": "Los Angeles Rams @ Philadelphia Eagles",
      "summary": "TD-scorer unders dominate in Rams–Eagles: the signals show anytime TD props with 7 unders to 1 over, plus 9 unders on first TD and 5 unders on last TD markets. The largest specific fades are Saquon Barkley’s anytime TD (−4216 and −4014 bps vs market) and Jalen Hurts’ anytime TD (−3532 bps), implying their scorer prices are too rich. Overall read: prioritize unders on high-profile Eagles TD props and be cautious chasing first/last TD yes prices. With no confidence range or best-price flags, keep stakes modest."

      "game": "Denver Broncos @ Los Angeles Chargers",
      "summary": "TD-scorer unders dominate this matchup, with broad downside across anytime TDs and a heavy under bias in both first- and last-TD markets. The largest individual edges are Omarion Hampton anytime TD under (flagged twice as the top value) and Ladd McConkey anytime TD under, implying Chargers skill-player scoring prices are inflated. Passing TD props lean slightly under, while pass- and rush-yardage signals are largely balanced, so the cleaner angle is fading TDs rather than yards. With no confidence range provided, keep stakes modest and treat this as a medium-conviction read."

      "game": "New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks",
      "summary": "TD-scorer unders dominate in Saints–Seahawks, with unders flagged in 8 of 9 anytime TD markets, 10 first-TD markets, and 6 last-TD markets. The most pronounced fades are Alvin Kamara and Jaxon Smith-Njigba anytime TD, each showing roughly -2,500 to -2,700 bps edges versus market. Passing-TD props also lean under (3 unders to 1 over), reinforcing a lower-touchdown environment. With no confidence distribution provided, uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest and focus on the Kamara/JSN anytime TD unders."

    {
      "game": "Dallas Cowboys @ Chicago Bears",
      "summary": "TD-scorer unders dominate in Cowboys–Bears: the model leans under across anytime TDs (17 unders vs 12 overs) and especially first- and last-TD markets (29 and 26 unders), with a smaller tilt toward pass-TD unders (3 vs 1). The main exception is CeeDee Lamb, whose anytime TD market shows one of the largest model-to-price gaps among individual players and would be the preferred over if you want exposure. Otherwise, the distribution argues for fading multiple longshot first/last TD darts rather than buying scorer overs broadly. With confidence bands unavailable, treat this as a moderate-conviction angle and keep stakes modest."

      "game": "Arizona Cardinals @ San Francisco 49ers",
      "summary": "TD-scoring unders dominate in this matchup, with the model showing 8 unders vs 1 over in anytime TDs and unders across first- and last-TD markets (10 and 6, respectively). The biggest edge is fading Christian McCaffrey’s anytime TD, where the model is 4,562–4,846 bps against the market, implying his price is significantly overbought. Consistent unders in first and last TD also suggest avoiding chalky yes bets in those markets. If you want a small, high-variance flier, “No Scorer” in the anytime TD market shows a positive edge (~+1,889 bps), but with no confidence range provided, treat these as higher-uncertainty angles and keep stakes modest."

      "game": "Kansas City Chiefs @ New York Giants",
      "summary": "TD-scorer unders dominate: the model shows anytime TD unders 8 of 9, plus first TD unders 10 and last TD unders 6. The biggest edges are fading Travis Kelce in anytime TD (-2549 bps vs market) and Malik Nabers in anytime TD (flagged twice at roughly -2333 and -2232 bps), with the broader slate also leaning under on first/last TD markets. With no confidence range and no best-price clustering provided, treat this as higher uncertainty and keep stakes modest."

      "game": "Detroit Lions @ Baltimore Ravens",
      "summary": "TD-scorer unders dominate in Lions–Ravens: anytime TD leans under in 8 of 9 markets, with clean under sweeps on first TD (10) and last TD (6). The biggest edges are fading Derrick Henry’s anytime TD (two under quotes at roughly -4,930 and -4,711 bps versus market) and Jahmyr Gibbs’ anytime TD under (~-3,532 bps), making those the priority angles. With unders clustering across first- and last-touchdown markets as well, a TD-unders portfolio fits the signal. Confidence dispersion isn’t provided, so treat this as higher-uncertainty and keep stakes modest."

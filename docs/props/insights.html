    <section class="game" data-key="tampa-bay-buccaneers-at-houston-texans">
  <h3>Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Houston Texans</h3>
  <p>Pass-game unders dominate here: model flags far more unders than overs on QB volume/efficiency (pass attempts 18U/8O, completions 22U/4O, pass yards 23U/7O, pass TDs 25U/5O) and a heavy lean to reception-longest unders (82 unders), with a mild tilt toward unders on receptions and receiving yards (92U vs 74O/80O). The top player edges align with that: Buccaneers RB Bucky Irving rush attempts under stands out as the biggest single prop edge, and Texans WR Nico Collins receptions under also grades strongly. Touchdown markets are split—anytime TD overs are abundant (169 overs) while first/last TD props lean under (167/132). Given these cross-currents, keep stakes modest and prioritize the pass-game unders and the Irving/Collins fades.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-chargers-at-las-vegas-raiders">
  <h3>Los Angeles Chargers @ Las Vegas Raiders</h3>
  <p>For Chargers–Raiders, the model leans toward TD-volume overs but timing unders. Anytime TD overs dominate (153–76), while first- and last-TD markets skew heavily under (172 and 136 unders), signaling broader scoring participation without a clear early/late scorer. Supporting a more methodical passing game, reception_longest unders are prominent (84 unders) alongside interceptions unders (24), with pass attempts tilting slightly under (9 overs, 19 unders) and receptions/receiving yards split (77/77 and 82/82). Player-level edges in the feed don’t map cleanly to this matchup, so this is a market-level read with medium uncertainty—keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="miami-dolphins-at-buffalo-bills">
  <h3>Miami Dolphins @ Buffalo Bills</h3>
  <p>Overall read: first-touchdown unders dominate, with a secondary lean toward Bills anytime-TD overs. The model shows a 29–20 skew to anytime-TD overs, and the biggest edges are Josh Allen and James Cook to score anytime, while first-TD markets flash 51 unders—suggesting value fading chalk in that market. Longest-play props lean under as well (18 unders on reception_longest and a smaller under signal on rush_longest), pointing to restrained explosive plays. Uncertainty is higher without a defined confidence band, so keep stakes modest and focus on Allen/Cook ATD overs and broadly fading first-TD prices.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="atlanta-falcons-at-carolina-panthers">
  <h3>Atlanta Falcons @ Carolina Panthers</h3>
  <p>TD unders dominate here across both anytime and first-TD markets. The largest edges are fades on Bijan Robinson anytime TD (-3866 bps), Chuba Hubbard anytime TD (-2135), and Drake London anytime TD (-1709), with our model showing materially lower scoring odds than the market. That read extends to first-TD, where these same names profile as overvalued. Given TD props’ high variance and no clear confidence band provided, keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cincinnati-bengals-at-minnesota-vikings">
  <h3>Cincinnati Bengals @ Minnesota Vikings</h3>
  <p>TD-scorer markets lean under in Bengals–Vikings, with unders flagged across both anytime TD and first TD. The biggest fades are Chase Brown anytime TD (-3242 bps vs market) and Justin Jefferson anytime TD (-2135 bps), and that skepticism extends to their first TD prices as well. With no defined confidence range and added variance from Brown’s role and Jefferson’s already-short TD pricing, keep stakes modest despite the apparent edges.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="green-bay-packers-at-cleveland-browns">
  <h3>Green Bay Packers @ Cleveland Browns</h3>
  <p>TD unders drive this matchup: signals show a clean sweep of first-TD unders (4/4) and a 3–1 lean to unders on anytime TDs. The clearest player angles are Romeo Doubs anytime TD under (about -1359 bps vs market) and Jerry Jeudy anytime TD under (about -913 bps), consistent with tempered WR TD expectations. With no confidence-range output provided, treat this as higher-uncertainty and keep stakes modest. Focus on targeted player TD unders or the first-TD under rather than chasing scarce overs.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="pittsburgh-steelers-at-new-england-patriots">
  <h3>Pittsburgh Steelers @ New England Patriots</h3>
  <p>TD-scoring unders dominate here, with value concentrated in both anytime TD and first-TD markets. The clearest edge is fading Jaylen Warren in the anytime TD market (model vs market −2439 bps), suggesting his scoring price is too rich. Kayshon Boutte also profiles as an anytime TD under (−773 bps), and first-TD prices on the usual suspects look similarly inflated. With limited confidence distribution data, treat this as higher-uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="indianapolis-colts-at-tennessee-titans">
  <h3>Indianapolis Colts @ Tennessee Titans</h3>
  <p>TD props lean under in Colts–Titans, with unders clustering on both anytime TD and first TD markets. The sharpest fades are Jonathan Taylor anytime TD (-3866 bps) plus Titans’ Tony Pollard (-3440) and Calvin Ridley (-1121), indicating the model sees lower-than-market scoring odds for the headliners. Confidence isn’t tightly quantified here, so treat this as higher uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-philadelphia-eagles">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ Philadelphia Eagles</h3>
  <p>TD scorer markets skew under here, with unders flagged in both anytime TD and first TD props. The biggest fades are anytime TD for Saquon Barkley (-3941 bps), Jalen Hurts (-3621 bps), and Kyren Williams (-2909 bps), where the market appears to overstate their scoring chances. That view is reinforced by parallel first TD unders across the board. Confidence detail is limited (n/a range), so treat this as a higher-uncertainty spot and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-orleans-saints-at-seattle-seahawks">
  <h3>New Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks</h3>
  <p>TD-scorer unders dominate here, with both anytime and first-TD markets skewing to the under. The clearest fades are Jaxon Smith-Njigba anytime TD (-2549 bps vs market) and Alvin Kamara anytime TD (-2333 bps), indicating materially lower scoring likelihood than current prices imply. Given the broad under signal, that caution likely extends to their first-TD prices as well. Confidence bands are unavailable (n/a), so treat this as higher-uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="dallas-cowboys-at-chicago-bears">
  <h3>Dallas Cowboys @ Chicago Bears</h3>
  <p>TD-scorer unders dominate in Cowboys–Bears: both anytime TD and first-TD markets lean under across four signals each. The clearest edges are on WRs, with CeeDee Lamb anytime TD showing about -2666 bps and Rome Odunze anytime TD around -1561 bps versus market, indicating value fading their TD prices. First-TD markets echo the same under lean. With model confidence not specified, treat this as higher uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="arizona-cardinals-at-san-francisco-49ers">
  <h3>Arizona Cardinals @ San Francisco 49ers</h3>
  <p>TD scorer markets skew under in Cardinals–49ers, with both anytime TD and first TD props showing clustered unders. The largest edge is fading Christian McCaffrey’s anytime TD, with a -4454 bps signal versus market. Secondary fades include Marvin Harrison Jr. anytime TD (-1561 bps) and Trey McBride anytime TD (-1491 bps). First TD props also lean under (four signals), but touchdown markets are high-variance, so keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="detroit-lions-at-baltimore-ravens">
  <h3>Detroit Lions @ Baltimore Ravens</h3>
  <p>TD-scorer unders dominate for Lions at Ravens, with the model leaning against both anytime and first-TD markets. The clearest fades are Detroit’s Jahmyr Gibbs anytime TD (under, -3136 bps vs market) and Baltimore’s Zay Flowers anytime TD (under, -2666 bps), with their first-TD unders consistent with the same signal. With no confidence-range or book-dispersion data provided, uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest.</p>

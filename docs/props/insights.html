    <section class="game" data-key="chicago-bears-at-detroit-lions">
  <h3>Chicago Bears @ Detroit Lions</h3>
  <p>Overall read: unders dominate on passing volume and splash plays, with first TD unders (125), last TD unders (94), reception_longest unders (96), and passing props skewing under (pass attempts 17 unders to 7 overs; pass TDs 21 unders to 7 overs). The strongest player edges are Jameson Williams rush yards under (-5326 bps) and Jared Goff rush yards under (-5178 bps), plus a notable lean to Amon-Ra St. Brown receptions under (-4999 bps). Receptions and receiving yards are broadly balanced (receptions 72 overs vs 74 unders; receiving yards 75 vs 75), and anytime TD shows more overs (107 vs 66), so uncertainty is higher outside the listed unders. Prioritize the rush-yard unders and keep stakes modest on reception-related fades.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="jacksonville-jaguars-at-cincinnati-bengals">
  <h3>Jacksonville Jaguars @ Cincinnati Bengals</h3>
  <p>Overall read: reception-related unders and TD timing unders lead this board. The model’s largest player edge is Ja’Marr Chase receptions under (-5678 bps), which aligns with a slight market lean to receptions and receiving yards unders (82 unders vs 68 overs on each). Chase Brown rush attempts under also stands out (-5601 bps), with the overall attempts market split (21/21) suggesting his posted number may be rich. While anytime TD overs show volume (127 vs 62), first- and last-TD unders dominate (139 and 106 unders), so lean under in those timing markets; uncertainty is higher without confidence bands, so keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-york-giants-at-dallas-cowboys">
  <h3>New York Giants @ Dallas Cowboys</h3>
  <p>Overall read: pass-game unders, highlighted by a broad lean to longest reception unders (84 unders) and a modest tilt against volume (pass attempts 6 over vs 18 under; pass TDs 11 over vs 17 under). The clearest player edges are CeeDee Lamb under receptions (largest edge on the board) and KaVontae Turpin under rush attempts. TD markets split—anytime TD overs are plentiful (130 over vs 57 under), while first- and last-TD props skew under (135 and 102 unders). With receptions and receiving yards essentially even (68/68 and 66/70), uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest and focus on the identified unders.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-england-patriots-at-miami-dolphins">
  <h3>New England Patriots @ Miami Dolphins</h3>
  <p>Passing-game unders dominate this matchup: the model leans under on pass attempts (5 O/23 U), pass yards (9 O/23 U), and pass TDs (6 O/26 U), with a strong tilt to longest reception unders (72 U), while TD markets are split (anytime TDs 132 O/77 U vs heavy first/last TD unders: 159 and 126). The clearest player edge is De&#x27;Von Achane unders on both rush attempts and rush yards (top negative bps signals), suggesting reduced rushing volume/efficiency for him relative to market. Rushing markets overall are mixed (rush attempts 23/23; rush yards 34/34), so outside the Achane angles and the broad passing/longest-reception fades, treat exposure as higher uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cleveland-browns-at-baltimore-ravens">
  <h3>Cleveland Browns @ Baltimore Ravens</h3>
  <p>Overall read: unders dominate, led by first/last TD unders and a heavy tilt to longest reception unders. Receiving props skew under (receptions 81 unders vs 63 overs; receiving yards 92 unders vs 62 overs), aligning with reduced explosive plays (reception_longest 80 unders). The clearest player angle is Derrick Henry unders—rush attempts and rush yards are the model’s top fades—consistent with a slight rush-unders lean (attempts 22 unders vs 12 overs; yards 26 unders vs 24 overs). Passing volume and efficiency markets are split (attempts/completions/TDs/yds essentially even) while anytime TD shows more overs, so uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="buffalo-bills-at-new-york-jets">
  <h3>Buffalo Bills @ New York Jets</h3>
  <p>RB-related unders and muted explosives lead the card, with the model’s biggest edges on Breece Hall rushing yards under and James Cook rushing attempts under. Directional counts also lean under for pass yards (12 unders vs 4 overs), receptions/receiving yards (52–60 and 57–67), and longest reception (74 unders), while first and last TD markets skew heavily to unders (159 and 129, respectively). That profile fits a slower, defense-forward game script despite anytime TD showing more overs (146–67). With several categories split (rush attempts and yards, pass attempts/completions), uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-tennessee-titans">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ Tennessee Titans</h3>
  <p>Overall read: receiver unders cluster, led by receptions and longest reception unders, while TD props are split. Receptions lean under (70 unders vs 48 overs) and reception_longest is heavily under (80 unders), with interceptions also shaded under (20 unders), whereas pass attempts/TDs/yards and rushing volume are largely balanced. The standout player edge is Puka Nacua receptions under, which grades as the strongest single-market angle here. With anytime TDs skewing over (157 overs vs 36 unders) but first/last TD firmly under (141 and 107 unders), uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest outside the Puka receptions under.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="san-francisco-49ers-at-new-orleans-saints">
  <h3>San Francisco 49ers @ New Orleans Saints</h3>
  <p>Despite a broad lean to anytime TD overs (127 over signals vs 47 unders), the cleaner angles are on rushing volume and longest-reception unders. Christian McCaffrey under rush attempts and under rush yards grade as the strongest edges, matching slight market-wide under tilts in rush attempts (18 unders vs 16 overs) and rush yards (24 unders vs 22 overs). Reception-longest unders are widely supported (64 under signals), while receptions and receiving yards are more mixed, and first-TD unders are common but often priced aggressively. With mixed signals across markets, uncertainty is moderate—prioritize CMC rushing unders and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="seattle-seahawks-at-pittsburgh-steelers">
  <h3>Seattle Seahawks @ Pittsburgh Steelers</h3>
  <p>Receiver-related unders lead the board: reception-longest unders are heavy (82 unders flagged), receptions lean under (72 unders vs 60 overs), and broader passing markets skew under as well (pass yards 20 unders vs 8 overs; pass TDs 21 unders vs 7 overs). The clearest player edge is Jaxon Smith-Njigba receptions under, which shows up repeatedly among the top deltas (−5543/−5383/−5146 bps). Touchdown markets are split—anytime TDs tilt to overs (104 vs 68), but first/last TD trend under (127 and 95 unders), making the latter a better fit with the overall under read. With no confidence range provided, keep stakes modest overall, with firmer conviction on JSN receptions under.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="carolina-panthers-at-arizona-cardinals">
  <h3>Carolina Panthers @ Arizona Cardinals</h3>
  <p>RB unders dominate here, with the board leaning under on rush attempts (30 unders vs 24 overs) and strong clusters on “longest” and TD-timing unders (first TD unders 129, last TD unders 99, reception longest unders 74, rush longest unders 38). The clearest player edges are James Conner rush attempts under (top edge at -5251 bps, echoed again) and Chuba Hubbard rush attempts under (-5223 bps). Passing is largely balanced (pass TDs/yds both 14–14; attempts 12–12), and receptions tilt slightly under (69 unders vs 53 overs), reinforcing a focus on RB attempt unders and longest-unders rather than air-volume angles. Mixed signals on receptions/yardage suggest moderate confidence—keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="denver-broncos-at-indianapolis-colts">
  <h3>Denver Broncos @ Indianapolis Colts</h3>
  <p>Overall read: pass-game unders dominate. The model shows heavy leaning to unders on reception longest, receiving yards, and pass TDs (e.g., 76 unders on longest reception and 20 unders vs 8 overs on pass TDs), alongside unders for first and last TD and even interceptions. The standout single-player edge is Jonathan Taylor rush attempts under, flagged as the strongest prop by margin. Confidence is moderate—focus on the clustered pass-game unders and Taylor attempts under, while noting anytime TD saw more overs than unders (120 vs 67), so TD markets are best approached via first/last TD fades rather than blanket anytime fades.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="philadelphia-eagles-at-kansas-city-chiefs">
  <h3>Philadelphia Eagles @ Kansas City Chiefs</h3>
  <p>For Eagles–Chiefs, touchdown timing and explosive-play props skew under: first TD unders dominate (143 signals) and last TD unders are strong (112), with reception_longest (64 unders) and rush_longest (30 unders) also leaning under, while anytime TD is only a mild over (107 vs 81). Receiving volume tilts slightly under (receptions 70 overs vs 78 unders; receiving yards 75 vs 87), interceptions lean under (24), and most passing volume (attempts, completions, TDs, yards) reads neutral with overs and unders evenly split. The only named player edges in the feed are for Saquon Barkley rush props, which don’t apply here, so there’s no single player driver—this is a market-structure lean toward first/last TD and longest-play unders. With no tight player-specific angles, uncertainty is higher; keep stakes modest and avoid heavy exposure to the balanced passing markets.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="atlanta-falcons-at-minnesota-vikings">
  <h3>Atlanta Falcons @ Minnesota Vikings</h3>
  <p>The model leans toward passing and explosive-play unders: pass attempts/completions/TDs/yards show just 6–7 overs versus 15–19 unders, and reception-longest unders appear 60 times. The clearest player edge is Bijan Robinson rush attempts under (flagged twice at roughly -5,614 and -5,191 bps), even with team rush-attempt signals split 23/23; Drake London receptions under (-5,177 bps) also tracks with a broader receptions (56 overs vs 72 unders) and receiving yards (59 vs 73) under tilt. Touchdown markets are mixed—anytime TD leans over (101 vs 70) while first/last TD are heavily skewed under (121 and 93)—so treat scorer props as higher variance. Overall, moderate confidence with a focus on Bijan rush attempts under and London receptions under; keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="tampa-bay-buccaneers-at-houston-texans">
  <h3>Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Houston Texans</h3>
  <p>Overall read: passing unders and longest-reception unders dominate, while anytime TD overs show a broad cluster but first/last TD tilt under. The clearest single-player target is Bucky Irving rush attempts, where model vs market shows a sizable mismatch; with team-level rush-attempt signals split, we prefer the under on his carries. Also lean under on QB passing volume (attempts, completions, TDs, and yards) to align with the aggregate under skew across those markets. Mixed signals on TD props and balanced rushing markets imply higher uncertainty—keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-chargers-at-las-vegas-raiders">
  <h3>Los Angeles Chargers @ Las Vegas Raiders</h3>
  <p>Overall read: touchdown props drive the edge—anytime TD overs show a strong tilt (123 vs 72), while first and last TD markets lean decisively to unders (143 and 105), suggesting multiple scorers but less clarity on who opens/closes. Explosive-play props skew under, with recurring unders on reception_longest and rush_longest, making longest reception/rush fades attractive. Quarterback volume looks mostly neutral with slight unders on attempts and pass TDs plus a stronger lean to interceptions unders, tempering enthusiasm for passing overs. With mixed signals elsewhere, keep stakes modest and focus on the clearest angles: anytime TD overs for broader scorer pools, and unders on first/last TD and longest reception/rush.</p>

  <div class="wrap" data-week-overview="Hey! So, for Week 10, we’re seeing a lot of strong edges in the player prop market, especially with RBs and QBs. Tyler Lockett is really standing out with a big edge on his receptions, and Matthew Stafford’s rush yards also look promising. Alvin Kamara&#x27;s rushing yards are worth a look too! The market is buzzing with anytime touchdown props, which shows a lot of potential for scoring plays, but unfortunately, no juicy arbitrage opportunities this week. Overall, it feels like a solid week with some high-confidence plays, so there’s definitely some value to chase!">

    <section class="game" data-key="las-vegas-raiders-at-denver-broncos">
  <h3>Las Vegas Raiders @ Denver Broncos</h3>
  <p>I’m really intrigued by the reception props in this matchup! Tyler Lockett looks like a solid pick for overs on receptions; our model shows he has a pretty strong edge there. With both teams&#x27; defenses, it feels like he could see plenty of targets. On the other hand, J.K. Dobbins’ rush attempts are also worth noting; the unders seem like a smart play given the way the market’s leaning. I’d say both of these plays have good potential, but remember, the market can be a bit tricky, so maybe don&#x27;t go all in.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="atlanta-falcons-at-indianapolis-colts">
  <h3>Atlanta Falcons @ Indianapolis Colts</h3>
  <p>I&#x27;m really intrigued by Jonathan Taylor&#x27;s rush attempts in this matchup against the Falcons. The numbers are leaning heavily towards the overs, suggesting that he could see a good amount of carries, especially with Atlanta&#x27;s defense possibly giving up some yards on the ground. Given all the buzz around his usage, I&#x27;d feel pretty confident backing him here. Just keep in mind that while the signs are strong, game dynamics can always throw a curveball. So, maybe bet a little lighter if you&#x27;re feeling cautious!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="baltimore-ravens-at-minnesota-vikings">
  <h3>Baltimore Ravens @ Minnesota Vikings</h3>
  <p>In this Ravens vs. Vikings matchup, I think the passing props are worth considering, especially for J.J. McCarthy. The strong lean towards overs on his passing yards and attempts shows he might be primed for a solid outing. Given how close those numbers are, I feel pretty solid about his passing yards—it’s looking like he could really air it out this game. Just keep in mind that things can change quickly, so maybe hedge your bets a bit if you&#x27;re not feeling 100% confident.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="buffalo-bills-at-miami-dolphins">
  <h3>Buffalo Bills @ Miami Dolphins</h3>
  <p>I&#x27;m really intrigued by the passing game in this matchup, especially when it comes to Josh Allen. His pass completions and attempts are both looking like strong overs, so I think he might be in for a big game against Miami&#x27;s defense. On the other hand, De&#x27;Von Achane&#x27;s rush attempts could be a good under bet since the numbers are heavily leaning that way. Overall, I feel pretty confident about Allen&#x27;s overs, but the Achane under has a bit more uncertainty, so maybe tread lightly on that one. Should be a fun game to watch!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-orleans-saints-at-carolina-panthers">
  <h3>New Orleans Saints @ Carolina Panthers</h3>
  <p>In this matchup, I’m really intrigued by Alvin Kamara’s rushing yards prop; he’s projected to get more than 50, which feels like a solid bet given how the Saints lean on him in the run game. On the flip side, Bryce Young’s passing yards also catch my eye, especially with a couple of strong signals about him going over his number. Both of these does present a bit of uncertainty, so while I wouldn’t go too heavy on them, they look worth exploring for a fun bet with some decent upside!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-york-giants-at-chicago-bears">
  <h3>New York Giants @ Chicago Bears</h3>
  <p>In this Giants-Bears matchup, I’m really liking the props for DJ Moore, especially his receiving yards, which seem to have a strong edge. Given his ability to stretch the field, hitting the over on his receiving yards feels pretty solid. On the other hand, I see some interesting angles with Brittain Brown potentially snagging an anytime touchdown, too, so that might be worth a little sprinkle. Just keep in mind that while these look promising, it’s always good to tread carefully since game dynamics can shift.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cleveland-browns-at-new-york-jets">
  <h3>Cleveland Browns @ New York Jets</h3>
  <p>Hey! I’m really eyeing the rushing yards for Quinshon Judkins in this game. The way the market has leaned heavy towards the overs for his rushing yards looks promising, especially given the strong edges we&#x27;ve seen. It just feels like a solid bet considering the flow of the game and how the defenses match up. I’d feel good about placing a decent wager there, but as always, keep in mind that there’s always some uncertainty in these matchups. Good luck!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="jacksonville-jaguars-at-houston-texans">
  <h3>Jacksonville Jaguars @ Houston Texans</h3>
  <p>I’m really liking the receiving props in this matchup, especially when it comes to Xavier Hutchinson&#x27;s numbers. He&#x27;s seeing some strong juice with his receiving yards clamped down at -5219 bps, which suggests he could have a decent game through the air. I’d also keep an eye on Davis Mills’ passing yards, which are showing a compelling edge at -5000 bps. This game feels like it could have some back-and-forth action, but with all the uncertainty surrounding the quarterback play, I’d say tread lightly on how much you invest in these props. Overall, they look promising but have their risks!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-england-patriots-at-tampa-bay-buccaneers">
  <h3>New England Patriots @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h3>
  <p>In this matchup between the Patriots and Buccaneers, I’m really intrigued by Baker Mayfield’s rushing props. The numbers show strong leanings towards his rush attempts and yards being pretty low—like, he may not run a ton, but when he does, it could be sneaky productive. With that -5564 bps on rush attempts, it suggests he might not have to scramble much against the Patriots&#x27; defense, so I&#x27;m tempted to take the under there. Honestly, I’d feel confident about the Mayfield rush yards too since the model really favors the under on that one as well. Just keep in mind there’s always a bit of uncertainty with quarterbacks&#x27; rushing paths, so maybe don&#x27;t go too heavy!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="arizona-cardinals-at-seattle-seahawks">
  <h3>Arizona Cardinals @ Seattle Seahawks</h3>
  <p>In this matchup, I find the receiving props really intriguing, especially with Michael Wilson looking like a solid pick for receiving yards. He’s showing a strong edge with the overs, and given the Cardinals&#x27; offensive dynamics, he might be a key target. Zach Charbonnet also stands out for his receiving yards, and with the way the Seahawks like to utilize their backs, I’d say there’s a good chance he could hit that over too. While I feel pretty confident about these plays, just keep an eye on how the game flows—you never know how things can shift during the game!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="detroit-lions-at-washington-commanders">
  <h3>Detroit Lions @ Washington Commanders</h3>
  <p>In this matchup, I’m really intrigued by Jared Goff’s passing props. The numbers suggest he could see a lot of action, especially with the edges pointing towards overs on both pass attempts and completions. Also, Amon-Ra St. Brown&#x27;s receptions feel like a solid bet; he’s a target magnet for Goff, which could lead to him easily hitting that over. This all seems pretty promising, though I’d say there&#x27;s some uncertainty with how often Goff might be throwing, so maybe don&#x27;t go too heavy on these. Just some solid options to consider!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-san-francisco-49ers">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ San Francisco 49ers</h3>
  <p>I’m really seeing some interesting angles with Matthew Stafford in this matchup. His rush yards and rush attempts props look particularly juicy, given the strong edges we have there—it seems like the bookies might be underestimating his mobility a bit. This feels pretty solid since he’s been more active with his legs lately, but I wouldn’t go too heavy, just to stay on the safe side with a little uncertainty hanging in the air. Overall, it could be worth a look if you&#x27;re feeling adventurous!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="pittsburgh-steelers-at-los-angeles-chargers">
  <h3>Pittsburgh Steelers @ Los Angeles Chargers</h3>
  <p>In this matchup, I’m really intrigued by Justin Herbert&#x27;s rushing props. The model leans heavily towards him hitting both the rush attempts and yards overs, which is pretty exciting considering his ability to make plays with his legs, especially in a game that could be more challenging through the air. It feels like a solid bet to take his rush attempts and yards overs. While I&#x27;m feeling pretty confident about Herbert, it&#x27;s worth noting that with these props, there’s always a bit of unpredictability, so maybe don’t go all in just yet but definitely consider it!</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="philadelphia-eagles-at-green-bay-packers">
  <h3>Philadelphia Eagles @ Green Bay Packers</h3>
  <p>In this matchup between the Eagles and Packers, I find the rush attempts for Jalen Hurts really interesting, especially given he’s been a dual-threat quarterback. The strong edges around his rush attempts suggest he could take off more than usual, particularly with the way defenses have been structured against him lately. On the other hand, the unders on Saquon Barkley&#x27;s rush attempts seem tempting; he might struggle to find running room against a formidable Eagles front. So, I&#x27;m leaning a bit more confidently on Hurts&#x27; rushing, but maybe keep the Saquon bet a little lighter given the uncertain dynamics there. Overall, it feels like Hurts could be in for a big rushing day!</p>

  <div class="wrap" data-week-overview="Week 6 looks tilted toward touchdown markets—411 anytime TD edges popped—plus plenty on receiving production (191 recv_yds, 150 receptions), with some soft RB rushing lines sprinkled in. The Giants are oddly the headline: Saquon Barkley’s rush yards is the top edge (-5597 bps), Wan’Dale Robinson’s receptions is right behind (-5577 bps), and Darren Waller’s anytime TD shows up twice with massive signals (5569 and 5472 bps). A.J. Brown’s receiving yards (-5557 bps) also stands out if you’re shopping WR overs. Confidence-wise, this profiles as a strong card: 151 plays rate above 80% confidence, not a “hold your nose” week. And if you like line shopping, there are 743 arbitrage spots worth poking at, so it’s a good week to compare books before you fire.">

    <p class="muted">AI-powered insights from our model. Choose a matchup to view analysis.</p>

    <section class="game" data-key="philadelphia-eagles-at-new-york-giants">
  <h3>Philadelphia Eagles @ New York Giants</h3>
  <p>I’m mostly into the receiving and RB yardage angles here. Saquon Barkley’s rush yards is the clearest flag from the model, and with Philly’s run defense I’d lean under if the number’s on the high side—this one feels pretty solid. Wan’Dale Robinson’s receptions also rate well given his short-area role, so I’d lean over there. AJ Brown’s receiving yards shows up too, but that’s a bit more volatile with game flow, so I’d tread lighter on that one.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="denver-broncos-at-new-york-jets">
  <h3>Denver Broncos @ New York Jets</h3>
  <p>This looks like an “unders” kind of game, especially on receptions and TD-related stuff, so the receiving props are where I’d start. Marvin Mims Jr. receptions under is my favorite — it’s showing up as the biggest edge (twice), and that lines up with the slight market lean toward reception unders. J.K. Dobbins rush yards under also looks interesting, but I’m a little less certain there because his workload and game script could swing, so I’d go lighter on that one. Overall, I feel pretty solid about Mims’ receptions under and cautiously interested in Dobbins’ rush yards under.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="seattle-seahawks-at-jacksonville-jaguars">
  <h3>Seattle Seahawks @ Jacksonville Jaguars</h3>
  <p>Honestly, the only thing our model is flagging here is the pass TDs market, but it’s a mixed read overall, and the strongest signal is oddly tied to Sam Darnold pass TDs—which doesn’t even apply to Seahawks-Jags. With that mismatch, I don’t see a clean angle on Geno or Trevor’s pass-TD numbers from this data alone. This one feels pretty uncertain, so I’d go light or even sit it out on pass TDs for this matchup.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-england-patriots-at-new-orleans-saints">
  <h3>New England Patriots @ New Orleans Saints</h3>
  <p>For Pats–Saints, the anytime TD market is the spot I’d target, and Rhamondre Stevenson stands out for an anytime score based on the model’s edge. That’s the clearest angle here and feels pretty solid. The pass-TDs market doesn’t show a real lean either way, so I’d be cautious there or just pass. I’d keep it simple: ride Stevenson’s anytime TD and avoid forcing anything else in this one.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="arizona-cardinals-at-indianapolis-colts">
  <h3>Arizona Cardinals @ Indianapolis Colts</h3>
  <p>For Cardinals–Colts, the anytime TD market looks the most appealing, with our directions leaning more toward unders than overs. The quirky angle that actually stands out is “No Scorer” in the anytime TD market — it’s definitely high variance, but the edge suggests there’s some value if you want a small, speculative sprinkle. On pass TDs, we don’t have anything actionable for this matchup; the only big signal there is Daniel Jones in another game, so I’d be wary of touching QB TD totals here. Overall, I’d tilt conservative on TD exposure and keep expectations in check given the uncertainty.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-baltimore-ravens">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ Baltimore Ravens</h3>
  <p>For Rams–Ravens, the passing markets look most interesting, with a lean toward pass TD unders and some real attention on Matthew Stafford’s pass yards. Stafford’s yardage is where the biggest edges show up, but they actually point both ways depending on the number you’re seeing, so this one has more variance and I’d go lighter unless you land a great line. For pass TDs, I’d lean under on both QBs (Lamar and Stafford), but I’d call that medium confidence rather than a slam dunk. Receiving and rushing yards are pretty split (overs and unders about even), so I’d be picky there rather than forcing a play.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="dallas-cowboys-at-carolina-panthers">
  <h3>Dallas Cowboys @ Carolina Panthers</h3>
  <p>I’d lean into the anytime TD market here — the model tilts a bit toward unders overall, while pass TDs look pretty even. The only specific flag in the feed is Tetairoa McMillan’s anytime TD showing a massive edge, which obviously isn’t usable for Cowboys–Panthers, and that kind of tells me there isn’t a clear player target in this matchup. With pass TDs split 2-and-2, I’d keep those small or pass. If you want a sweat, nibble on the anytime TD unders, but I’d go lighter given the uncertainty.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cleveland-browns-at-pittsburgh-steelers">
  <h3>Cleveland Browns @ Pittsburgh Steelers</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the receiving props here, and Jerry Jeudy’s receiving yards stand out as the cleanest angle to target in this Browns–Steelers matchup. The broader pass-yards market leans a bit toward unders, so if you want a secondary play, looking at QB pass-yds unders makes some sense, just with a little more variance than Jeudy’s spot. Anytime TDs tilt slightly to the under as well, but that market can swing on one play, so I’d go lighter there. Overall, Jeudy’s receiving yards feels pretty solid, and the rest are more “sprinkle” territory.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-chargers-at-miami-dolphins">
  <h3>Los Angeles Chargers @ Miami Dolphins</h3>
  <p>For Chargers–Dolphins, the anytime TD market looks like the best angle to attack. The standout our model keeps flagging is Darren Waller anytime TD with a sizable edge, so if that number is posted, that’s the one I’d circle first. Meanwhile, pass TDs lean under overall here, so I’d be more inclined to fade some of those QB TD totals than chase overs—but there’s more volatility in that market, so I’d go lighter. Overall, Waller ATD feels pretty solid, with the pass-TD unders more of a cautious add.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="tennessee-titans-at-las-vegas-raiders">
  <h3>Tennessee Titans @ Las Vegas Raiders</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look like the best angle in this one, and I’m especially into Elic Ayomanor’s receiving yards under—it’s showing one of the clearest edges on the board. For touchdowns, I’d also look at fading Brock Bowers to score anytime; he’s a beast, but our read leans under in that market. Ayomanor’s under feels pretty solid, whereas the Bowers no-TD has more variance baked in, so I’d go a bit lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cincinnati-bengals-at-green-bay-packers">
  <h3>Cincinnati Bengals @ Green Bay Packers</h3>
  <p>For this Bengals-Packers matchup, the anytime TD market looks more like a fade spot than a “bet the scorer” game. If I’m picking a name, I’d lean against Chase Brown finding the end zone—our read skews under on most TD props here, and his specific signal looks weak. There’s also a spicy dart with “No Scorer” in the anytime TD market; it’s obviously a longshot and a sweaty watch, but it does show real value. I feel fairly good about fading Brown, while the No Scorer angle is much higher variance, so I’d go lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="san-francisco-49ers-at-tampa-bay-buccaneers">
  <h3>San Francisco 49ers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h3>
  <p>For 49ers–Bucs, the pass TD unders look like the smartest angle. Baker Mayfield in particular stands out, with our model flagging his passing TD under as the strongest edge (it even pops in multiple runs). The matchup sets up for tougher red-zone conversions for Tampa, so this feels a bit more solid than your average QB under. That said, weird scripts and short fields can always lead to a couple quick scores, so I’d play it but not go overboard.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="detroit-lions-at-kansas-city-chiefs">
  <h3>Detroit Lions @ Kansas City Chiefs</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the anytime TD market here—the overs look better overall—and Xavier Worthy stands out the most, with multiple strong signals on him to find the end zone. Amon-Ra St. Brown also looks solid for an anytime TD if you want a second angle. The pass-TDs market is more of a toss-up (our signals are split), so there’s more uncertainty there and I’d go lighter compared to the anytime TDs.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="buffalo-bills-at-atlanta-falcons">
  <h3>Buffalo Bills @ Atlanta Falcons</h3>
  <p>For this one, I’m most interested in the anytime TD market, and it actually looks like more of an under spot. The best fades to score are Darnell Mooney on the Falcons plus Dawson Knox and Ray Davis on the Bills—those are where the edge against an anytime TD looks strongest. I feel decent about these, but TDs can be swingy, so I’d go a bit lighter and be ready for some variance. If you want just one, fading a Mooney TD is my favorite of the bunch.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="chicago-bears-at-washington-commanders">
  <h3>Chicago Bears @ Washington Commanders</h3>
  <p>The anytime TD market is the spot to look in Bears–Commanders. Our model leans to overs overall (7 overs vs 4 unders), and Rome Odunze stands out with the biggest edge for an anytime TD—he even shows up twice among the strongest signals. There’s also an angle on “No Scorer” in the anytime TD market, which hints at some volatility in how many touchdowns we actually get, so if you touch that, make it smaller. I feel most comfortable backing Odunze to score, but anytime TDs are naturally swingy, so keep expectations reasonable.</p>

    <section class="game" data-key="chicago-bears-at-detroit-lions">
  <h3>Chicago Bears @ Detroit Lions</h3>
  <p>Unders lead this board, especially on first TD (125 unders), last TD (94 unders), and longest reception (96 unders), with passing props tilted slightly to unders (pass TDs 21 unders, attempts 17 unders), while anytime TDs are the main over pocket (107 overs vs 66 unders). The clearest player angles are Jameson Williams rush yards under and Jared Goff rush yards under, plus Amon-Ra St. Brown receptions under—each among the largest model edges. Because receptions (72 overs vs 74 unders), receiving yards (75/75), and rush yards (28/30) are basically split and rush attempts are dead even (23/23), treat this as higher-uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="jacksonville-jaguars-at-cincinnati-bengals">
  <h3>Jacksonville Jaguars @ Cincinnati Bengals</h3>
  <p>Overall read: reception-volume and explosive-play unders, with some selective TD overs. The model’s strongest player edge is Ja’Marr Chase receptions under, which aligns with the 82–68 tilt toward receptions/receiving yards unders and the 88-count wave of reception-longest unders; Chase Brown rush attempts under is another standout despite a neutral rush-attempt market overall. Touchdown markets split—anytime TDs lean over (127 vs 62) while first/last TDs skew heavily under (139 and 106), so be cautious with TD exotics. With pass attempts/completions/yards roughly balanced, uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest and focus on the Chase receptions under and Brown rush-attempts under angles.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-york-giants-at-dallas-cowboys">
  <h3>New York Giants @ Dallas Cowboys</h3>
  <p>Unders dominate in timing and explosiveness: the model is heavy against first/last TD markets and reception/rush longest, with a lean to QB volume unders (attempts, completions, pass TDs), while anytime TD overs are broadly supported. Yardage and standard receptions are more balanced, so confidence is lower overall. The biggest player-level discrepancy shows on CeeDee Lamb receptions, and KaVontae Turpin rush attempts looks inflated relative to his typical usage. Given the mixed yardage/receptions signals, keep stakes modest and prioritize the first/last TD and longest-play unders alongside the Turpin rush-attempt fade.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-england-patriots-at-miami-dolphins">
  <h3>New England Patriots @ Miami Dolphins</h3>
  <p>Passing unders cluster here: the model leans under on pass attempts (23 unders vs 5 overs), pass yards (23 vs 9), and pass TDs (26 vs 6), with a broad tilt to reception-longest unders (72). The strongest player-specific edges focus on De&#x27;Von Achane unders for rush attempts and rush yards (largest deltas around -4.8k and -4.7k bps), suggesting the market may be overestimating his volume/efficiency. Touchdown timing props are stark: heavy unders for first TD (159) and last TD (126) despite anytime TD leaning to overs (132 vs 77), so if betting TDs, prefer cautious anytime exposure and fade first/last TD longshots. With rushing volume split (attempts 23/23; yards 34/34) and receptions/receiving yards nearly balanced (61/73; 65/71), uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cleveland-browns-at-baltimore-ravens">
  <h3>Cleveland Browns @ Baltimore Ravens</h3>
  <p>Overall read: unders dominate first/last TD and longest reception, while anytime-TD leans over, so I’d fade first/last-TD darts and target longest-reception unders. The clearest angle is Derrick Henry unders—rush attempts and rush yards both rate as the top edges on the board by bps. Passing markets are mixed (attempts/completions/TDs/yards roughly even) and receptions/receiving yards tilt slightly under, so beyond Henry’s volume/yardage fades, keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="buffalo-bills-at-new-york-jets">
  <h3>Buffalo Bills @ New York Jets</h3>
  <p>Overall read skews under on event props: first-TD unders (159) and last-TD unders (129) are pronounced, reception-longest trends under (74), and pass yards lean under (12 unders vs 4 overs), though anytime-TD props tilt over. The strongest player edges back RB unders, with Jets RB Breece Hall rush yards under showing the largest edge and Bills RB James Cook rush attempts under also grading well. Given the split signals and neutral aggregate counts on rush yards (32/32) and rush attempts (17/17), uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-tennessee-titans">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ Tennessee Titans</h3>
  <p>Overall read: receiving volume and explosive plays skew under, with receptions and longest-reception unders leading, and first/last TD props tilting under despite a broad anytime-TD over bias. Receptions show more unders than overs (70 vs 48) and reception-longest unders are heavy (80), with a lean to pass completions unders (16 vs 8). The clearest single-player angle is Puka Nacua receptions under, which rates as the top edge by margin. Mixed signals in the TD markets introduce some uncertainty, so keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="san-francisco-49ers-at-new-orleans-saints">
  <h3>San Francisco 49ers @ New Orleans Saints</h3>
  <p>Signals point to a split TD market—anytime TD overs are widespread (127 vs 47), but first TD (126 unders) and last TD (64 unders) skew under, with reception-longest unders also prevalent (64). The clearest edge is Christian McCaffrey unders: rush attempts (-5608 bps) and rush yards (~-5300 bps) are the largest deltas, aligning with mild under leans across rushing volume/yardage. Passing props are largely even (completions 6/6, pass TDs 6/6, pass yards 7/7), so uncertainty is higher overall—keep stakes modest outside the McCaffrey fades. In TD markets, lean toward fading first/last TD shots rather than chasing the broad ATD overs.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="seattle-seahawks-at-pittsburgh-steelers">
  <h3>Seattle Seahawks @ Pittsburgh Steelers</h3>
  <p>Overall read tilts to pass-game and receiving unders, with a strong lean against TD timing props. First TD unders (127) and last TD unders (95) lead the way, while pass yards show more unders than overs (20 vs 8), receptions lean slightly under (72 vs 60), and reception longest unders are heavy (82). The clearest player angle is Jaxon Smith-Njigba receptions under, which carries the largest modeled edge among player markets. Anytime TD overs (104 vs 68) inject some scoring variance, so keep stakes modest despite the under cluster.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="carolina-panthers-at-arizona-cardinals">
  <h3>Carolina Panthers @ Arizona Cardinals</h3>
  <p>RB rush-attempt unders dominate here, with the model’s largest edges on James Conner under rush attempts and Chuba Hubbard under rush attempts, matching a slight market tilt to rush-attempt unders (30 unders vs 24 overs). Touchdown timing props lean under (first TD unders 129, last TD unders 99), but anytime TD leans over (121 vs 60), so be selective on TD exposure. Ancillary signals favor fewer explosives and lighter volume—reception-longest unders (74), receptions skewing under (69 unders vs 53 overs), plus small leans to rush yards unders (39 vs 35) and pass completions unders (16 vs 8). Confidence is highest on the RB attempt unders; keep stakes modest elsewhere given the mixed TD picture.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="denver-broncos-at-indianapolis-colts">
  <h3>Denver Broncos @ Indianapolis Colts</h3>
  <p>Unders lead the way for Broncos–Colts, with strong down arrows on first and last TD, reception longest, interceptions, and most passing/receiving yards and TD markets, while only anytime TD shows more over signals. The standout player angle is Jonathan Taylor rush attempts under, flagged multiple times with roughly a 5.6k bps edge toward the under, suggesting his carry volume is priced too high even as team-level rush-attempt signals are split. Rush yards also skew under, reinforcing a general under posture on volume/efficiency props. Given some mixed readings (notably balanced rush-attempt signals and anytime-TD overs), treat this as moderate confidence, with Taylor attempts under the clearest look.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="philadelphia-eagles-at-kansas-city-chiefs">
  <h3>Philadelphia Eagles @ Kansas City Chiefs</h3>
  <p>Unders dominate the derivative markets here: first TD scorer unders (143) and last TD unders (112) lead, with a broad lean to longest reception unders (64), while receptions (70 vs 78) and receiving yards (75 vs 87) also tilt slightly under across pass catchers. Anytime TDs skew modestly to overs (107 vs 81), but QB volume is split—pass attempts/completions/TDs/yards all balanced—plus rushing volume is essentially even, so the strongest conviction sits in TD timing and longest-reception unders rather than yardage or volume. There’s a mild lean to QB interception unders (24) but with less coverage, so treat that as secondary. With core volume markets balanced, variance is higher—keep stakes modest and focus on the longest-reception and first/last TD unders for your primary exposure.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="atlanta-falcons-at-minnesota-vikings">
  <h3>Atlanta Falcons @ Minnesota Vikings</h3>
  <p>Overall, the board leans under on passing volume and WR efficiency: pass attempts/completions/TDs/yards all skew to unders (e.g., 7–19 on pass yards) and reception longest unders are heavy (60 unders). The clearest individual edge is Bijan Robinson rush attempts under (roughly a 5,600 bps advantage), echoed by a second strong signal on the same market despite an overall split board for rush attempts. Drake London receptions under also rates as a top signal (~5,200 bps), aligning with broader unders in receptions (56–72) and receiving yards (59–73). TD markets are mixed (anytime leans over 101–70, but first TD and last TD unders dominate), so keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="tampa-bay-buccaneers-at-houston-texans">
  <h3>Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Houston Texans</h3>
  <p>Market-vs-model signals lean under on passing production in Buccaneers–Texans: pass completions (3 overs vs 17 unders), pass TDs (3–21), pass yards (6–18), and attempts (7–13), with first/last TD props also skewing under (133 and 99 unders), while anytime TD leans over (135–48). The clearest player edge is Bucky Irving rush attempts under, which holds the top three basis-point values on the board. Receptions and receiving yards are close to even (39–49 and 45–49), and rushing volume/yardage splits are flat (attempts 18–18, yards 27–27), so concentrate on the clustered pass-game unders and Irving attempts under. With no confidence range or best-book data, treat this as higher-uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-chargers-at-las-vegas-raiders">
  <h3>Los Angeles Chargers @ Las Vegas Raiders</h3>
  <p>TD props lean bullish overall: the feed shows a clear skew toward anytime TD overs (123 vs 72), while first- and last-TD markets tilt heavily to unders (143 and 105, respectively), pointing to broader scoring distribution rather than a single early or late scorer. Explosive plays look discounted with a sizable bias to longest reception unders (56) and fewer turnover signals via interceptions unders (24), while passing volume metrics (attempts/completions/yards/TDs) are largely balanced. With no trustworthy player-level standouts for this specific matchup in the feed (the listed “strongest edges” reference unrelated names), treat this as a market-level angle and keep stakes modest. Practically, lean into anytime TD overs for secondary options or RBs and fade longest reception for primary WRs on both sides, while avoiding interception overs.</p>

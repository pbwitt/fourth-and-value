  <div class="wrap" data-week-overview="With 13 games on tap, the board is flooded with anytime TD angles (2,446 edges), and the receiving markets look soft too—receiving yards (2,180) and receptions (2,095) are driving a lot of value. The biggest standouts are Jaylin Noel popping multiple times on receptions with massive edges (around 6.7k bps), Luke Schoonmaker on receiving yards (≈6.2k bps), and even a QB splash play with Tyler Shough’s pass TDs (≈6.5k bps). Confidence looks solid overall—there are 1,608 high-confidence plays at 80%+—so it’s more of a “lean in” week than a pass-and-wait one. No true arbitrage spots (0), so it’s about picking off mispriced props rather than free middles. If you’re scanning quickly, start with anytime TDs and receptions, and then poke at some tight end yardage numbers where the models are flagging soft lines.">

    <section class="game" data-key="atlanta-falcons-at-new-england-patriots">
  <h3>Atlanta Falcons @ New England Patriots</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look like the best lane here, and Kyle Pitts’ receptions really stand out. Our numbers show multiple strong edges on his receptions compared to everything else on the board, so I prefer leaning over on Pitts rather than messing with the more mixed pass attempts/yards or the rushing markets. I feel pretty good about Pitts, but props are still swingy week to week, so I’d go in with confidence while not overextending.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="carolina-panthers-at-green-bay-packers">
  <h3>Carolina Panthers @ Green Bay Packers</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the volume angles here: Chuba Hubbard’s rush attempts and Bryce Young’s pass attempts/completions. Hubbard’s rush attempts looks like the cleanest play, and I’d lean over rather than messing with yards, since his role tends to be steadier than his efficiency. For Young, overs on pass attempts and pass completions make sense if Carolina is throwing plenty, but there’s a bit more game-flow uncertainty there. I feel pretty solid about Hubbard, and I’d go a little lighter on the Young overs.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="chicago-bears-at-cincinnati-bengals">
  <h3>Chicago Bears @ Cincinnati Bengals</h3>
  <p>For Bears–Bengals, the receiving and anytime TD markets look like the spots to poke at, with a slight lean toward unders rather than chasing headline overs. That nudges me toward fading the bigger names a bit — think Ja’Marr Chase on receptions/receiving yards and DJ Moore in those same markets if books post aggressive numbers. The passing stuff for Joe Burrow (attempts, yards, completions) looks pretty fair, so I wouldn’t force anything there. I feel okay about the receiver unders here, but there’s still some game-flow uncertainty, so I’d go lighter rather than trying to make a big score on one ticket.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="denver-broncos-at-houston-texans">
  <h3>Denver Broncos @ Houston Texans</h3>
  <p>For Broncos–Texans, the passing-volume unders look the most interesting — there’s a lean toward unders on both pass attempts and pass completions. That points me toward Russell Wilson under pass attempts and C.J. Stroud under pass completions, since both fit that theme for this matchup. I’d also peek at receptions unders — Courtland Sutton under receptions makes sense if his line is on the high side. Confidence is moderate rather than rock-solid, so maybe go lighter and be picky about the number you take.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="minnesota-vikings-at-detroit-lions">
  <h3>Minnesota Vikings @ Detroit Lions</h3>
  <p>For Vikings-Lions, the volume props look most interesting. I’m leaning under on J.J. McCarthy pass attempts—there’s a clear tilt toward unders in that market and it lines up with our strongest edge, so that one feels pretty solid. Aaron Jones’ rush attempts under also makes sense given the overall rush-attempts market skewing under, though game script could swing his workload a bit, so I’d go a little lighter there. The receiving markets look pretty balanced and the anytime TD market leans under but can be noisy, so I wouldn’t force anything beyond those.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="indianapolis-colts-at-pittsburgh-steelers">
  <h3>Indianapolis Colts @ Pittsburgh Steelers</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look like the best way into this Colts–Steelers game, while most of the passing and rushing markets look pretty balanced. Darnell Washington’s receptions stands out most—our edge centers there—so I’d lean under on his catches rather than banking on multiple grabs. Beyond that, pass attempts/completions/yards and even rush attempts don’t show a clear signal either way, so I’m less eager to fire on those. I feel solid about the Washington receptions angle; everything else is more uncertain, so I’d tread lighter.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-chargers-at-tennessee-titans">
  <h3>Los Angeles Chargers @ Tennessee Titans</h3>
  <p>This one looks like a spot to fade some passing volume — the model leans to more unders on pass attempts/completions and on receptions/receiving yards overall. Justin Herbert under pass completions makes sense to me with the Chargers likely leaning more run-heavy, and that one feels fairly solid. Will Levis under pass yards is also in play, but I’d go lighter there since a couple deep balls to DeAndre Hopkins or Calvin Ridley can wreck an under fast. If you want something on the ground, Tony Pollard over rush attempts fits the matchup and the market tilt toward rushing volume, though I’d call that a medium-confidence look.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="san-francisco-49ers-at-new-york-giants">
  <h3>San Francisco 49ers @ New York Giants</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the Giants rushing unders here against San Francisco’s front. Tyrone Tracy Jr.’s rush attempts under stands out since Devin Singletary should handle the bulk of the work and game script could skew pass-heavy if New York trails. Singletary’s rushing yards under also makes sense in this matchup—tough sledding inside and he may get more of his production as a receiver than on the ground. These feel pretty solid, though Tracy’s usage can be a bit volatile, so I’d go lighter on him and a touch firmer on Singletary; the receiving markets look more balanced overall.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="jacksonville-jaguars-at-las-vegas-raiders">
  <h3>Jacksonville Jaguars @ Las Vegas Raiders</h3>
  <p>For Jags–Raiders, the receiving props look like the cleanest angle, and Tre Tucker’s receptions is the one I’d circle — it’s showing the biggest edge in our data among anything here. That one feels pretty solid relative to the rest of the board. The other receptions and receiving yards spots look more balanced, so I’d go lighter outside of Tucker. If you’re tempted by anytime TDs, the model leans under overall, but those can flip on one play, so I’d be careful there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-orleans-saints-at-los-angeles-rams">
  <h3>New Orleans Saints @ Los Angeles Rams</h3>
  <p>For Saints–Rams, the TD angle looks like a fade: the market leans under on anytime TDs and passing TDs, so I’d rather bet against a score than chase one. If you’re eyeing a name like Cooper Kupp or Taysom Hill to find the end zone, I’d lean under instead. On the receiving side, I’d target receptions for guys like Puka Nacua or Chris Olave over their receiving yards, since yards look like a coin flip while catches give you a cleaner volume path. Nothing here is a hammer, so I’d treat it as medium confidence.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="kansas-city-chiefs-at-buffalo-bills">
  <h3>Kansas City Chiefs @ Buffalo Bills</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look like the best way in here, and James Cook’s receptions are the clearest angle. We’ve got our biggest edge on his catches, so I like backing Cook to pile up receptions, and that one feels pretty solid. Meanwhile, the model leans under on passing TDs, so a lighter look at Josh Allen or Patrick Mahomes under their pass TDs makes sense given the extra variance.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="seattle-seahawks-at-washington-commanders">
  <h3>Seattle Seahawks @ Washington Commanders</h3>
  <p>For Seahawks–Commanders, the receiving props look the most interesting. Tory Horton actually stands out the most, with both his receptions and receiving yards showing the biggest edges; with the overall receiving-yards board leaning under, I’d shade his yards that way and be more neutral on catches. Jayden Daniels’ pass completions also rate well, but the completions market is pretty balanced overall, so there’s a bit more uncertainty there and I’d go lighter. I feel reasonably good about the Horton yards angle, with Daniels’ completions as more of a smaller look.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="arizona-cardinals-at-dallas-cowboys">
  <h3>Arizona Cardinals @ Dallas Cowboys</h3>
  <p>I really like the receiving props in Cardinals–Cowboys. Jake Ferguson receptions stands out as a nice look to the over—he’s been a steady target and our edges point that way. On the flip side, Luke Schoonmaker receiving yards feels more like an under given he’s the secondary tight end and his usage can disappear. I feel pretty solid about Ferguson, while Schoonmaker is a bit thinner, so I’d go lighter there.</p>

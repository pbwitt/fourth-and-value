  <div class="wrap" data-week-overview="With 15 games on tap, the anytime TD market is the headline this week (411 edges), with a strong secondary wave in receiving yards (191) and receptions (150) — and the biggest edges mostly lean under on yards/catches while TDs skew over. Standouts: Saquon Barkley’s rush yards look notably high (-5597 bps), Wan’Dale Robinson’s receptions are inflated (-5577 bps), and Darren Waller to score is popping multiple times (+5569 bps). If you like price shopping, there are 743 arbitrage spots, so definitely worth checking multiple books before firing. Overall confidence looks solid with 151 plays grading 80%+, so this slate isn’t as tight as some recent weeks. I’d start with the TD market, then hunt selective unders in WR/RB yardage and receptions — especially around the Giants pieces.">

    <section class="game" data-key="philadelphia-eagles-at-new-york-giants">
  <h3>Philadelphia Eagles @ New York Giants</h3>
  <p>I’m most into the receiving angles here, with a sneaky rushing look on Saquon. Wan’Dale Robinson over receptions makes sense—the model shows a strong edge and his short-area role fits if the Giants lean on quick hitters. I also like Saquon Barkley over rushing yards, since Philly can lean on him if they’re playing from ahead and he should have the volume to get there. AJ Brown’s receiving yards is the trickier one; I’d actually lean under given the chance the Eagles spread it around and don’t need as many downfield shots, so I’d go smaller on that.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="denver-broncos-at-new-york-jets">
  <h3>Denver Broncos @ New York Jets</h3>
  <p>For Broncos-Jets, the receiving props look the most interesting to me. Marvin Mims Jr. receptions under stands out as the best angle—his usage has been up and down and the data is leaning under on receptions in general, so unless the number is tiny, I like fading him. I’d also consider Garrett Wilson longest reception under if the line is optimistic; the model leans toward reception-longest unders overall and this could be more of a methodical Jets game. Interception unders show some value too—Aaron Rodgers INT under makes sense—but there’s more randomness there, so I’d go lighter on that one.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="seattle-seahawks-at-jacksonville-jaguars">
  <h3>Seattle Seahawks @ Jacksonville Jaguars</h3>
  <p>The pass-TD market looks like the most interesting angle here—our signals split, with one QB leaning over and the other under, so that’s where I’d focus. That puts Geno Smith and Trevor Lawrence front and center, since the model is nudging in opposite directions on their TD totals rather than pointing to anything in the run game. One oddity: the feed is showing a big Sam Darnold edge, which obviously doesn’t apply to Seahawks-Jags, so I’m tossing that as a data hiccup. With the split read and that mismatch, this feels more like a light touch than a full send.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-england-patriots-at-new-orleans-saints">
  <h3>New England Patriots @ New Orleans Saints</h3>
  <p>I’m leaning into the RB anytime TD market here. The one that really stands out is Rhamondre Stevenson to score — our model shows the biggest edge on his anytime TD, and his role plus New England’s red-zone usage make this one feel pretty solid. Beyond that, the pass-TD market looks murky with our signals split, so anything on Derek Carr or Drake Maye is more variance-driven. I’d make Stevenson the primary play and be lighter on the QB/receiver stuff in this matchup.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="arizona-cardinals-at-indianapolis-colts">
  <h3>Arizona Cardinals @ Indianapolis Colts</h3>
  <p>For Cards-Colts, the touchdown markets look the most interesting to me, with the data leaning toward more unders in the anytime TD space. That makes me more inclined to fade a couple of the chalkier names like Jonathan Taylor or Trey McBride to score at current prices, while the “No Scorer” longshot is weirdly showing some value as a tiny sprinkle-only flier. Passing TDs look pretty balanced here, so I don’t feel a strong push on Kyler Murray or Anthony Richardson overs. Overall this feels decent but not a slam dunk, so I’d size a bit lighter on the TD fades and treat the no-scorer angle as just a fun dart.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-baltimore-ravens">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ Baltimore Ravens</h3>
  <p>This matchup looks like a spot to fade splash plays, with Stafford’s passing yardage being the tricky hinge. There’s real disagreement on his number across books—if you catch a high posting, I lean under against a Ravens pass rush that can squeeze possessions; if it’s notably lower, I’d rather pass or even consider the over, so that one’s very price-sensitive. I do like Puka Nacua longest reception under given how Baltimore limits explosives; that feels pretty solid. For a lighter look, Lamar Jackson under interceptions makes sense with how controlled he’s been, but I wouldn’t go heavy there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="dallas-cowboys-at-carolina-panthers">
  <h3>Dallas Cowboys @ Carolina Panthers</h3>
  <p>This looks like a Dallas control spot, so the anytime TD market is more interesting on the fade side for Carolina. With the data leaning to more anytime-TD unders overall, I’d look at Adam Thielen to not score (and you could extend that to Chuba Hubbard) given their red-zone struggles. If you want an over, Jake Ferguson anytime TD makes sense—Dak looks his way near the goal line and Carolina’s been soft against tight ends. I feel pretty good about the Panthers fades, while Ferguson is a reasonable sprinkle but with the usual TD variance, so maybe go lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cleveland-browns-at-pittsburgh-steelers">
  <h3>Cleveland Browns @ Pittsburgh Steelers</h3>
  <p>This looks like a lower-explosive passing game, so the longest reception unders are the most appealing angles. Jerry Jeudy stands out: with Amari Cooper likely drawing the tougher coverage, Jeudy should live underneath, which makes his longest reception under (and even his receiving yards under if the number is a bit rich) make sense. For Pittsburgh, I like Najee Harris’ longest rush under against a nasty Browns front that doesn’t give up many chunk runs, and there’s a mild lean to Russell Wilson under pass yards if the Steelers stick to a run-first script. I feel best about the longest-reception and Najee longest-rush looks; the Wilson yards is thinner, so go a little lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-chargers-at-miami-dolphins">
  <h3>Los Angeles Chargers @ Miami Dolphins</h3>
  <p>TD markets look like the best angle here — the model leans to anytime-TD overs but is cooler on passing-TD totals, so I’d rather back skill guys than QB TDs. For Miami, Raheem Mostert or De’Von Achane anytime TD makes sense since they finish a ton of drives near the goal line, while I’d be wary of taking Tua over on passing TDs. If you want a Chargers sprinkle, Gus Edwards’ anytime TD fits as their short-yardage hammer. I feel pretty good about the Dolphins RB TDs; the QB pass-TD unders are viable too but there’s more randomness there, so I’d go lighter.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="tennessee-titans-at-las-vegas-raiders">
  <h3>Tennessee Titans @ Las Vegas Raiders</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look like the best angle here, with a lot of unders showing up. Elic Ayomanor’s receiving yards under really stands out — the model has a strong signal there and his role/targets could be pretty thin, so that one feels pretty solid. I also like Brock Bowers’ anytime TD under; there’s a lot of red-zone competition on Vegas and touchdowns are swingy by nature, so I’d go lighter on that. Overall, I’m most comfortable fading Ayomanor’s yards and sprinkling smaller on the Bowers TD under.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cincinnati-bengals-at-green-bay-packers">
  <h3>Cincinnati Bengals @ Green Bay Packers</h3>
  <p>I’m leaning under-heavy in this one, especially in the TD markets—there’s even an edge on “No Scorer,” though that’s a high-variance sweat. The clearest player fade is Chase Brown on anytime TD; the numbers are pretty bearish on him getting in, so I’d be more interested in his “no TD” than chasing a yes. I also like the longest reception unders broadly, so if you catch an inflated number on someone like Christian Watson or Ja’Marr Chase, the under lines up with how the data is leaning. I feel decent about the Brown fade and those longest-reception looks, but for the TD stuff in general I’d go a bit lighter because variance is real.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="san-francisco-49ers-at-tampa-bay-buccaneers">
  <h3>San Francisco 49ers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h3>
  <p>For this one, the QB passing TD unders look most appealing, especially Baker Mayfield under on pass TDs. The data has Mayfield as the clearest edge, and it matches the matchup: San Francisco’s pass rush and coverage usually squeeze red-zone drives into field goals. If you want a second angle, Brock Purdy under on pass TDs also makes some sense since the Niners finish plenty with McCaffrey on the ground, but that’s shakier because Shanahan dials up easy red-zone throws. I feel pretty solid about the Mayfield under; the Purdy under is more of a lighter lean.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="detroit-lions-at-kansas-city-chiefs">
  <h3>Detroit Lions @ Kansas City Chiefs</h3>
  <p>The receiving/TD props look most interesting here, and the data really likes Xavier Worthy for an anytime TD—his speed plus how KC schemes him up gives him a few paths to score. Amon-Ra St. Brown also stands out for an anytime TD thanks to his massive target share and red-zone chemistry with Goff. I feel pretty good about those two angles, while first-TD darts look thinner and the QB pass-TD markets are more mixed, so I’d go a bit lighter there. If you want action, lean into Worthy/St. Brown anytime TDs and keep everything else smaller.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="buffalo-bills-at-atlanta-falcons">
  <h3>Buffalo Bills @ Atlanta Falcons</h3>
  <p>For Bills–Falcons, the anytime TD market looks like the sweet spot. Dawson Knox really stands out since Josh Allen leans on him in tight red‑zone windows, and our numbers put his TD odds a bit higher than what the prices suggest. Ray Davis also looks live as Buffalo’s short‑yardage hammer who can scoop a goal‑line plunge, while Darnell Mooney’s speed gives him real splash‑play equity for Atlanta. TDs are volatile, so I feel pretty solid about Knox, medium on Davis, and lighter on Mooney given his boom‑bust nature.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="chicago-bears-at-washington-commanders">
  <h3>Chicago Bears @ Washington Commanders</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the receiving/TD angles here, and Rome Odunze anytime TD is the one that really stands out—our data leans toward anytime TD overs overall, and his red‑zone/deep‑shot usage makes him the clearest target. That play feels pretty solid relative to the rest of the board. If you want a spicy flier, “No Scorer” grades surprisingly well for long odds, but that’s super high variance, so maybe go lighter there. I’d mostly steer clear of first‑TD darts—the signals lean under and that market is extra noisy.</p>

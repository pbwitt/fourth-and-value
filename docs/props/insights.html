  <div class="wrap" data-week-overview="Week 7’s shaping up nicely: with 15 games, the biggest theme is a flood of anytime TD edges (1,590 of them), with receiving yards (837) and rushing yards (553) next in line—so touchdown markets look soft and worth prioritizing. The standout values pop around Raheim Sanders’ anytime TD (two massive edges at 6100 and 5833 bps), Chase Brown’s rush attempts (showing twin top-tier edges at -5967 and -5867 bps), and Kenneth Gainwell’s receptions (-5960 bps). No real arbitrage to chase (0 spotted), but there’s still plenty to fire on with 515 high-confidence (&gt;80%) plays flagged. Overall vibe: a solid week with exploitable RB usage and TD markets—good slate to be selective and lean into those top edges.">
    <h1>Fourth &amp; Value — Insights (Week 7)</h1>
    <p class="muted">AI-powered insights from our model. Choose a matchup to view analysis.</p>

    <section class="game" data-key="pittsburgh-steelers-at-cincinnati-bengals">
  <h3>Pittsburgh Steelers @ Cincinnati Bengals</h3>
  <p>This looks like a spot to lean into rushing attempts and some passing unders. The clearest target is Chase Brown rush attempts under — it’s the strongest angle in our data (flagged twice), and the overall rush-attempt signals tilt slightly to the under. If you want a secondary look, the broad signals point under on pass yards and pass TDs, but there’s more game-script volatility there, so I’d tread lighter. Receptions and receiving yards look pretty balanced, so I’d probably leave those alone unless you’ve got a strong read.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-jacksonville-jaguars">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ Jacksonville Jaguars</h3>
  <p>The rushing markets are the most interesting here, with Kyren Williams’ rush attempts really standing out as the clearest angle. We’ve got multiple strong edges pointing toward the under on his attempts, so that’s the one I’d prioritize. On the passing side, Matthew Stafford and Trevor Lawrence props (attempts/completions/yards) look pretty balanced, so I don’t see a big edge there. The anytime TD market leans under overall too, so I’d be cautious chasing TD overs; Kyren’s rush-attempt under feels the most solid of the bunch, while the rest are more uncertain.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="carolina-panthers-at-new-york-jets">
  <h3>Carolina Panthers @ New York Jets</h3>
  <p>This one looks like a Breece Hall game — despite the broader under lean on anytime TDs, he stands out with our strongest edges by a mile for an anytime TD, and that’s the angle I feel best about. Beyond that, the yardage stuff (rush_yds and recv_yds) tilts slightly toward unders overall, so I’d be cautious chasing overs there. The passing markets (attempts, completions, yards, TDs) look pretty balanced, which adds some uncertainty, so if you dabble outside Hall’s TD, I’d keep it lighter. Overall, Hall anytime TD feels the most solid play here.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-orleans-saints-at-chicago-bears">
  <h3>New Orleans Saints @ Chicago Bears</h3>
  <p>This looks like a spot where I’d be more comfortable fading touchdowns than chasing them—anytime TD unders are getting a lot more love than overs here. The one player prop that really stands out is Spencer Rattler’s pass attempts, which screams under given the edge and the uncertainty around his snaps. I’d take a swing there but a bit lighter since backup QB usage can get weird. Outside of that, the rest of the passing volume stuff (attempts/completions/yards) feels pretty balanced, so I wouldn’t force anything.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="miami-dolphins-at-cleveland-browns">
  <h3>Miami Dolphins @ Cleveland Browns</h3>
  <p>For Dolphins-Browns, the receiving props look like the cleaner angle, and I slightly prefer the unders on receiving yards given the model leans that way overall. That points me toward yardage fades on guys like Amari Cooper or Jaylen Waddle rather than messing with receptions, which look much more balanced. The anytime TD market is also skewed to the under, so I’d be cautious chasing a Raheem Mostert touchdown in this spot. Nothing here is a hammer, so I’d keep it lighter and pass on most of the QB volume stuff, which feels pretty 50/50.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="las-vegas-raiders-at-kansas-city-chiefs">
  <h3>Las Vegas Raiders @ Kansas City Chiefs</h3>
  <p>For Raiders–Chiefs, the receiving yards props look like the best spot to attack. Rashee Rice’s receiving yards stands out most here—among everything on the board, that’s the one I feel best about. If there’s a Brashard Smith receiving yards line posted, it also looks interesting, but his role is a bit uncertain, so I’d go lighter. I’d be careful with passing TDs in this one, since the read tilts toward unders there, so I’d rather focus on the receiving yards market.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="philadelphia-eagles-at-minnesota-vikings">
  <h3>Philadelphia Eagles @ Minnesota Vikings</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look like the spot here, with a lot of unders in play, and A.J. Brown’s receiving yards is the clearest angle—his yardage under is showing the biggest edge. If you want a QB angle too, the pass TD market leans under, so I’d side with Jalen Hurts to stay under rather than banking on multiple passing scores. Brown’s yards feels pretty solid to me; the TD stuff is a little swingy, so I’d go lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-england-patriots-at-tennessee-titans">
  <h3>New England Patriots @ Tennessee Titans</h3>
  <p>I’m most into the receiving yards unders here, and Rhamondre Stevenson really stands out — our model has a strong edge on his receiving yards under compared to everything else. With receiving yards leaning under across the board, that one feels pretty solid. The anytime TD market also tilts under, so I wouldn’t be chasing many TD overs. Pass and rush stuff looks more balanced, so I’d tread lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-york-giants-at-denver-broncos">
  <h3>New York Giants @ Denver Broncos</h3>
  <p>For Giants–Broncos, the receiving props look like the best angle. The biggest edge here is Evan Engram’s receiving yards, and with the board leaning slightly to unders on both recv_yds and receptions, I’d side with his under. The pass attempts, completions, and even pass yards markets look pretty balanced, so they’re less appealing. I feel reasonably good about the Engram under, but it’s not a lock—there’s some role/usage variance—so maybe go a bit lighter.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="indianapolis-colts-at-los-angeles-chargers">
  <h3>Indianapolis Colts @ Los Angeles Chargers</h3>
  <p>This matchup looks like an under lean, especially on passing and touchdowns. For Justin Herbert, the under on pass TDs or even completions makes sense since both pass-TDs (8 overs vs 20 unders) and completions (7 vs 17) are tilted to the under—feels pretty solid, just not a sure thing. Anthony Richardson’s pass completions under fits the same theme, though with pass-attempts split (12/12) there’s a bit more volatility, so I’d go a little lighter there. If you want a receiver angle, Michael Pittman Jr.’s receiving yards under tracks with the slight recv-yds under lean (14 vs 18), and anytime TDs in general look like fades given how strongly those skew to the under.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="green-bay-packers-at-arizona-cardinals">
  <h3>Green Bay Packers @ Arizona Cardinals</h3>
  <p>The receiving yards market looks like the most interesting spot here. Josh Jacobs’ receiving yards stands out as the clearest edge—it even shows up twice among the strongest edges—so that’s the one I’d prioritize. Matthew Golden’s rush yards also shows a sizable edge, but with more uncertainty around his usage, I’d go lighter there. Most of the other passing and receptions markets look pretty even, and anytime TDs lean under overall, so I’m moderately confident on Jacobs and more cautious elsewhere.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="washington-commanders-at-dallas-cowboys">
  <h3>Washington Commanders @ Dallas Cowboys</h3>
  <p>I’d start with the receiving props here — CeeDee Lamb’s receiving yards looks like the clearest angle, and I’m comfortable riding his over given the strong edge showing up there. On the flip side, the model leans pretty hard toward rush yards unders overall, so I’d look at Brian Robinson Jr. under rushing yards if you want a second piece, though that one’s more sensitive to game flow. I feel better about Lamb’s receiving yards as the steadier play, with the rushing under more of a lighter look.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="atlanta-falcons-at-san-francisco-49ers">
  <h3>Atlanta Falcons @ San Francisco 49ers</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look like the cleanest angle here — Drake London’s receiving yards stands out as the best look, and I’d lean to the over on his yardage. The QB passing markets (attempts, completions, yards, TDs) feel pretty efficient, so I wouldn’t force anything there. If you want a touchdown sweat, Darnell Mooney anytime TD is the one I’d take a stab at, but TDs are volatile and the broader market leans under on those, so maybe go lighter. Overall, London’s yards feels fairly solid, while Mooney TD is more of a higher-variance sprinkle.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="tampa-bay-buccaneers-at-detroit-lions">
  <h3>Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Detroit Lions</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look like the best angle here, especially Amon-Ra St. Brown’s receptions—our numbers flag his catches as the standout, and the way Detroit feeds him makes that feel pretty solid. If you want a little upside play, Cade Otton’s anytime TD is interesting, since Tampa does scheme him near the goal line, but touchdowns are naturally volatile so I’d keep that one smaller. Overall, I’m most confident in Amon-Ra’s receptions and a bit more cautious on the Otton TD.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="houston-texans-at-seattle-seahawks">
  <h3>Houston Texans @ Seattle Seahawks</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look the most interesting here, and they lean under. The clearest spot is Jaxon Smith-Njigba under on receiving yards — it’s the strongest edge in the data and matches the broader recv_yds under trend. I’d also lean under on passing yards for Geno Smith or C.J. Stroud, but that read’s a bit squishier, so maybe go lighter there. Anytime TD looks pretty tight with a slight under lean, so I wouldn’t force anything.</p>

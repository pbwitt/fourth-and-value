  <div class="wrap" data-week-overview="Big Week 9 board with 15 games, and the market is screaming TD misprices: anytime TD props lead the way with 1,593 edges, with receiving yards (846) and rushing yards (571) right behind. The loudest one-off outlier is Luke Schoonmaker’s receiving yards under at a massive -6,246 bps. Raheim Sanders is the clear headline in the TD market, popping multiple times with 5,800–6,100 bps edges on anytime TD. No true arbitrage spots (0), so it’s about hunting bad numbers rather than risk-free plays. With 703 high-confidence tags, this looks like a solid, get-aggressive week—lean into TD markets and mix in some yardage spots where books are soft.">
    <h1>Fourth &amp; Value — Insights (Week 9)</h1>
    <p class="muted">AI-powered insights from our model. Choose a matchup to view analysis.</p>

    <section class="game" data-key="pittsburgh-steelers-at-cincinnati-bengals">
  <h3>Pittsburgh Steelers @ Cincinnati Bengals</h3>
  <p>For Steelers–Bengals, the receiving props look a little shaky — our stuff leans slightly to unders on receptions and receiving yards — so I’d be careful chasing overs on guys like Ja’Marr Chase or George Pickens. The clearest angle is pass TDs, where it’s pretty under-heavy, so leaning Kenny Pickett under pass TDs makes sense. If you want some upside, the anytime TD market tilts a touch to the over, which makes a Najee Harris anytime TD sprinkle reasonable. I feel better about the pass-TD under; the TD sprinkle is a bit thinner, so I’d go lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-jacksonville-jaguars">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ Jacksonville Jaguars</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the rushing angle here, specifically Kyren Williams’ rush attempts — that’s the clearest spot to attack in this matchup and feels pretty solid compared to everything else. After that, the market is leaning under on QB volume and scores, so I’d look at Matthew Stafford or Trevor Lawrence for unders on pass attempts or pass TDs, but with a lighter touch since those can swing on game script. The receiving stuff (receptions and receiving yards) looks more balanced, so I don’t see a big edge there. Overall, Kyren’s rush attempts is the one I’d prioritize.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="carolina-panthers-at-new-york-jets">
  <h3>Carolina Panthers @ New York Jets</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the passing and RB receiving angles here. Against the Jets’ pass rush and corners, Bryce Young pass attempts under and Bryce Young pass yards under make sense since Carolina’s likely to play conservatively and could struggle to sustain drives. On the Jets side, I’d lean under on Breece Hall receptions if New York is ahead and leaning on his carries instead of dump-offs. I feel pretty solid about the Young unders; Hall’s receptions are more game‑flow dependent, so go lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-orleans-saints-at-chicago-bears">
  <h3>New Orleans Saints @ Chicago Bears</h3>
  <p>I’m mostly interested in the rushing and QB volume props here, and I’d be careful chasing anytime TD overs since our model leans heavily to unders in that market. Alvin Kamara’s rush yards is the standout — it’s showing the biggest edge on the board for us, so that one feels pretty solid. Spencer Rattler’s pass attempts also looks interesting, but attempts can swing a lot with game flow, so there’s more uncertainty there. Net-net, Kamara rush yards is my favorite angle, with Rattler attempts as a lighter add if you want a second look.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="miami-dolphins-at-cleveland-browns">
  <h3>Miami Dolphins @ Cleveland Browns</h3>
  <p>The anytime TD market is the most interesting here, with Raheim Sanders standing out—our numbers show a big edge on his anytime TD, though touchdown props can be swingy, so I’d treat it as a lighter poke. Beyond that, the model generally leans under on passing volume, so I’m inclined to look at Tua Tagovailoa’s pass attempts or completions unders if the lines are on the higher side. Same idea with Deshaun Watson’s volume unders—there’s a slight tilt that way, but nothing massive, so that’s more of a modest lean. Receiving and rushing yardage look pretty balanced overall, so I don’t see a strong case to force anything there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="las-vegas-raiders-at-kansas-city-chiefs">
  <h3>Las Vegas Raiders @ Kansas City Chiefs</h3>
  <p>For this one, the receiving yards market looks like the cleanest angle — the model leans to unders there — so I’d look at Travis Kelce or Davante Adams under their yardage if books hang big numbers. Pass TDs are skewing more to the under too, so an under on Patrick Mahomes’ pass TDs (especially if they post 2.5) makes sense in a divisional game. There’s a small lean to overs on anytime TDs, so Kelce anytime TD is a reasonable sprinkle if you want some action, but it’s definitely more volatile. I feel best about the receiving yards unders; the TD angles are playable but I’d go lighter.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="philadelphia-eagles-at-minnesota-vikings">
  <h3>Philadelphia Eagles @ Minnesota Vikings</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the receiving yards market here — we’re leaning toward unders overall, so fading a bigger number on someone like Jordan Addison or DeVonta Smith in recv_yds makes sense if the lines are juicy. The one I actually like on the other side is Jalen Hurts rush_yds, which shows the strongest edge and matches how he’s used with designed runs and scramble chances. Pass_yds and pass_TDs look pretty balanced, so I’d mostly leave those alone. I feel pretty solid about Hurts’ rushing, while the receiver unders are playable but a little more fragile if this turns into a pass-happy script.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-england-patriots-at-tennessee-titans">
  <h3>New England Patriots @ Tennessee Titans</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the QB passing unders here. Cam Ward jumps out: the strongest edges are on his pass completions and pass yards leaning under, and the broader market is tilting under on completions (and even more so on pass TDs) in this matchup. I feel pretty solid about Ward’s completions under, with his pass yards under also in play but a bit noisier since the yards market is more balanced overall. If you dabble in pass TDs, I’d keep it lighter given the volatility there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-york-giants-at-denver-broncos">
  <h3>New York Giants @ Denver Broncos</h3>
  <p>Big-picture, the passing-volume markets look like the spot here — our signals lean under on pass attempts and completions, and even receptions/receiving yards skew a touch to the under, which points to a more run-tilted game. Bo Nix is the one player who really stands out from this slate: his rush yards show the strongest individual edge, and that lines up with Denver using his legs rather than forcing a high-attempt day. I feel pretty good about Nix rush yards as the priority, while the pass-attempt/completion unders are appealing but a bit more fragile if the script flips. So I’d lean Nix rush yards first and go lighter on the pass-volume unders.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="indianapolis-colts-at-los-angeles-chargers">
  <h3>Indianapolis Colts @ Los Angeles Chargers</h3>
  <p>For Colts–Chargers, the cleaner looks are on unders, especially pass TDs and some rushing yards. The numbers lean pretty strongly to pass-TD unders overall, so Justin Herbert under 1.5 pass TDs and the same for Anthony Richardson make sense; that angle feels fairly solid. We’re also seeing more unders than overs on rush yards, which puts Jonathan Taylor’s rush-yards under on the radar, though I’d go a bit lighter there because he can flip a script with one long run. Passing and receiving yardage/volume look more balanced, so those feel thinner compared to the TD and rushing angles.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="green-bay-packers-at-arizona-cardinals">
  <h3>Green Bay Packers @ Arizona Cardinals</h3>
  <p>The receiving and usage props look like the sweet spot here. Jordan Love’s pass completions is the one I trust most, and I’d lean over given how Green Bay’s been letting him distribute underneath. Trey McBride’s receptions also stand out—he’s such a focal point that the over makes sense, though there’s a bit more week-to-week variance, so I’d go a little lighter there. And if you want one on the ground, Josh Jacobs’ rush attempts looks playable toward the over with his bell-cow role, but game script can always throw a curveball, so confidence is more medium than high.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="washington-commanders-at-dallas-cowboys">
  <h3>Washington Commanders @ Dallas Cowboys</h3>
  <p>I’m leaning toward the rushing yards unders in this one, and Jacory Croskey‑Merritt’s rush yards under is the cleanest angle given both the general under lean on rush‑yds and his specific edge. I’m also eyeing Luke Schoonmaker’s receiving yards, but the signals on his recv‑yds are split, so that feels like a lighter dabble or even a pass unless the number looks soft. More broadly, anytime TDs are skewing under here, but that market can be swingy, so I’d keep it cautious.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="atlanta-falcons-at-san-francisco-49ers">
  <h3>Atlanta Falcons @ San Francisco 49ers</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in Bijan Robinson’s rush yards — that’s the one spot our model flags with a real edge, so it feels like the cleanest angle in this matchup. Beyond that, the receiving yards board leans more to unders than overs, so those look playable as a secondary take but I’d go lighter. Anytime TDs also skew under overall, though that market can be pretty swingy, so I’m less confident there. The QB passing props (attempts, completions, yards, TDs) look pretty balanced, which makes them more of a pass unless you’ve got a strong read.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="tampa-bay-buccaneers-at-detroit-lions">
  <h3>Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Detroit Lions</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the rushing-yards unders here, especially on Jared Goff and Baker Mayfield. Goff almost never runs by design and Detroit keeps him clean in the pocket, so his under feels pretty solid, while Mayfield can scramble but it’s usually spike-y and matchup-driven, so there’s a bit more variance. Rachaad White’s rush-yards under also makes sense with Detroit’s front likely to squeeze early-down runs and push Tampa toward the air if they fall behind. I’d have the most confidence in Goff, with a lighter touch on Mayfield and White since game script could swing their carry totals.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="houston-texans-at-seattle-seahawks">
  <h3>Houston Texans @ Seattle Seahawks</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look like the spot to attack in Texans–Seahawks, with more unders showing up than overs. Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s receiving yards under is my favorite angle — he’s the clearest standout among the WR yardage lines, and that one feels fairly solid. I also lean under on C.J. Stroud’s pass completions, but that market’s tighter, so I’d go lighter there. If you’re picking spots, I’d prioritize JSN’s receiving yards under and be a bit more conservative elsewhere.</p>

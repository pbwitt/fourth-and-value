    <section class="game" data-key="chicago-bears-at-detroit-lions">
  <h3>Chicago Bears @ Detroit Lions</h3>
  <p>Pass-centric unders lead this matchup—model tilts under on pass TDs (7 overs vs 21 unders), attempts (7–17), completions (10–14), yards (13–15), plus interceptions and reception-longest unders (96). The strongest individual edges are unders on Jameson Williams rush yards, Jared Goff rush yards, and Amon-Ra St. Brown receptions. TD markets are split: anytime TD leans to overs (107–66) while first/last TD tilt heavily to unders, suggesting more value fading longer-shot TD angles than attacking ATD overs. With receptions, rush attempts, and rush yards closer to even, uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="jacksonville-jaguars-at-cincinnati-bengals">
  <h3>Jacksonville Jaguars @ Cincinnati Bengals</h3>
  <p>Overall read: TD-timing unders and receiving/longest unders lead the board, with first TD unders 139 and last TD unders 106, plus a strong reception-longest under signal (88) and a lean to receptions/receiving yards unders (82 unders vs 68 overs each), partially offset by anytime TD overs (127 vs 62). The standout player edge is Ja’Marr Chase receptions under, which is the largest single-model edge, and Chase Brown rush attempts unders also flag as notable. Many core passing and rushing volume markets are balanced (e.g., pass attempts/completions/TDs/yards and rush attempts/yards split), so uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest. No clear book-specific pricing advantage emerged here.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-york-giants-at-dallas-cowboys">
  <h3>New York Giants @ Dallas Cowboys</h3>
  <p>Overall read is mixed: anytime TD overs dominate (130 vs 57), but first/last TD and longest reception props skew under (135 and 102 unders; 84 unders on reception_longest), with passing volume leaning down (pass attempts 6 overs vs 18 unders and pass TDs 11 overs vs 17 unders). The biggest player edges are concentrated on CeeDee Lamb receptions and KaVontae Turpin rush attempts, and Lamb also fits the broader longest-reception-under theme. With several categories effectively even (receptions 68–68; rush attempts 20–20; rush yards 35–35), treat this as a higher-uncertainty spot and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-england-patriots-at-miami-dolphins">
  <h3>New England Patriots @ Miami Dolphins</h3>
  <p>Passing unders dominate: pass attempts (5 over vs 23 under), pass TDs (6 vs 26), pass yards (9 vs 23), and longest reception unders (72 signals) point to a conservative air game for both sides. TD markets split, with anytime TD leaning over (132 vs 77) but heavy fades on first and last TD (159 and 126 unders), so prioritize first/last TD unders rather than fighting the anytime market. Player-wise, De&#x27;Von Achane shows the strongest edges to the under on rush attempts and rush yards, making his usage/yardage a fade candidate despite aggregate rushing signals being neutral. Confidence is higher on the passing-unders cluster, while RB props carry more variance—keep stakes modest there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cleveland-browns-at-baltimore-ravens">
  <h3>Cleveland Browns @ Baltimore Ravens</h3>
  <p>Model-vs-market signals tilt under-heavy: first and last TD markets show strong under lean (158 and 95 unders, respectively), and longest reception unders are widespread (80), alongside skews to unders in receptions (81) and receiving yards (92). The largest single-player edges center on Derrick Henry unders—both rush attempts and rush yards—aligning with slight portfolio-wide under leans in rushing (rush attempts unders 22 vs 12 overs; rush yards unders 26 vs 24). Passing volume is more balanced (attempts, completions, TDs, yards all split evenly), while anytime TD leans to overs (126 vs 87), so be selective about where you press. With no confidence range provided, treat this as moderate uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="buffalo-bills-at-new-york-jets">
  <h3>Buffalo Bills @ New York Jets</h3>
  <p>Model signals lean under on yardage props, highlighted by a strong cluster on reception-longest unders (74 flags) and a pass yards under tilt (12 unders vs 4 overs), while TD markets split—anytime TD overs are frequent (146 vs 67) but first and last TD unders dominate (159 and 129). The sharpest player angles are RB unders: Breece Hall rush yards under ranks as the top edge, and James Cook rush attempts under also rates well. Net read: capped rushing production relative to market despite some anytime TD over value. With confidence dispersion unspecified, keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-tennessee-titans">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ Tennessee Titans</h3>
  <p>Pass-catcher unders lead the card here: receptions show more unders than overs (70 vs 48), reception-longest is heavily under (80 unders), and pass completions lean under (16 unders vs 8 overs), while attempts and yards are mostly neutral. The clearest player angle is Puka Nacua receptions under, which carries the largest basis-point edge on the board. Touchdown markets are split—anytime TD overs are abundant (157), but first and last TD lean under (141 and 107), making scoring props noisier and warranting modest stakes. There’s also a smaller tilt to QB interception unders (20 unders), reinforcing a general under bias on individual passing outcomes.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="san-francisco-49ers-at-new-orleans-saints">
  <h3>San Francisco 49ers @ New Orleans Saints</h3>
  <p>Overall, the board shows a split: anytime TD overs are broadly favored (127–47), but there’s a strong lean to unders on first/last TD and longest props (first TD unders 126; last TD unders 64; reception_longest unders 64), with receiver yards also tilting under (61–41). The clearest player angle is Christian McCaffrey rushing fades—our biggest edges are his rush attempts under (~-5608 bps) and rush yards under (~-5300 bps). There’s a mild bias to QB pass-attempt unders (10 unders vs 2 overs), while receptions are essentially even (45–45). With several markets near-balanced, treat this as higher uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="seattle-seahawks-at-pittsburgh-steelers">
  <h3>Seattle Seahawks @ Pittsburgh Steelers</h3>
  <p>Unders dominate in Pittsburgh, especially on passing and splash plays, with heavy leans to first/last TD unders (127 and 95), reception-longest unders (82), and pass yards/TDs unders (20 and 21 vs 8 and 7 overs). The standout player angle is Jaxon Smith-Njigba receptions under, which repeatedly tops the model’s edges and fits a slight receptions-under tilt (72 unders vs 60 overs). That said, anytime TD props skew to overs (104 vs 68), and attempts/completions are more balanced, so there’s some cross-current. Net: favor pass-game and longest-play unders—anchored by JSN receptions under—but with modest stakes given the TD market split.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="carolina-panthers-at-arizona-cardinals">
  <h3>Carolina Panthers @ Arizona Cardinals</h3>
  <p>Unders dominate the volatility/usage markets here—big clusters on first/last touchdown and longest reception unders—while receptions and receiving yards are more balanced and anytime TD shows a countering tilt to overs. The sharpest conviction is RB rush-attempt unders, led by James Conner and Chuba Hubbard projecting below their posted carries, with Conner in particular showing the largest model gap. With passing attempts/TDs/yards split and that anytime TD overs cluster muddying the scoring outlook, treat this as higher-uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="denver-broncos-at-indianapolis-colts">
  <h3>Denver Broncos @ Indianapolis Colts</h3>
  <p>Unders dominate across the air: receptions, receiving yards, and reception longest all lean under, with pass TDs and pass yards also skewing under; anytime TDs show an over tilt, but both first-TD and last-TD markets are heavy unders. The clearest player angle is Jonathan Taylor rush attempts under, which flags the largest edge even though overall rush-attempt signals are balanced. Interception props lean under as well, pointing to a more conservative, lower-variance passing environment. Given limited confidence detail, treat this as higher uncertainty and keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="philadelphia-eagles-at-kansas-city-chiefs">
  <h3>Philadelphia Eagles @ Kansas City Chiefs</h3>
  <p>Market-wide signals point to TD-timing unders and explosive-play fades in Eagles–Chiefs: first-TD unders (143) and last-TD unders (112) lead, with reception-longest unders (64) and interceptions unders (24) also showing consistent value, while anytime-TD overs (107 vs 81) are only a mild lean. Pass attempts/completions/TDs/yards are balanced, and rush attempts/yds are split, so there’s no strong directional edge in volume markets. No player-specific edges surfaced for this matchup—the strongest model flags are for Saquon Barkley rush props, which are irrelevant here—so this is a market-level angle rather than a player-led spot. Given the mixed breadth beyond TD timing and longest-reception fades, uncertainty is higher; keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="atlanta-falcons-at-minnesota-vikings">
  <h3>Atlanta Falcons @ Minnesota Vikings</h3>
  <p>Passing game unders dominate: the model leans under on pass attempts, completions, yards, and TDs (each with roughly 2–3x more unders than overs), plus a broad unders skew on longest reception and both first and last TD markets. The standout player signals are Bijan Robinson rush attempts under (flagged twice as the top edge) and Drake London receptions under. TD props are mixed—anytime TD shows more overs, while first/last TD lean heavily under—and rushing volume is split (rush attempts 23/23; rush yards 41/41), so uncertainty is higher; keep stakes modest.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="tampa-bay-buccaneers-at-houston-texans">
  <h3>Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Houston Texans</h3>
  <p>Our model leans toward a muted passing environment: unders cluster across QB props (attempts 7–13 O/U, completions 3–17, yards 6–18, TDs 3–21) with longest reception unders (48) also prominent. TD markets are split—anytime TD overs are plentiful (135 vs 48 unders), but both first and last TD lean under (133 and 99 unders), pointing to dispersed scoring rather than a single early/late strike. The clearest player edge is Bucky Irving rush attempts under, which carries the largest basis-point advantage toward the under on the board. Mixed TD signals imply moderate uncertainty—keep stakes modest and focus on Irving’s rush-attempts under alongside selective fades of QB volume.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-chargers-at-las-vegas-raiders">
  <h3>Los Angeles Chargers @ Las Vegas Raiders</h3>
  <p>Overall read skews conservative: first and last TD markets lean hard to unders (143 and 105 signals, respectively), and “longest” props are under-heavy as well (56 unders on longest reception, 20 unders on longest rush), implying fewer explosive plays in Chargers–Raiders. Anytime TD shows an over tilt (123 vs 72), suggesting multiple potential scorers but less confidence on who strikes first or last. Passing volume leans modestly under (pass attempts 12 unders vs 8 overs; pass TDs slightly under), while receptions, receiving yards, and rushing yards are essentially balanced, so avoid heavy positions there. With conflicting TD signals and even splits across yardage markets, uncertainty is higher—keep stakes modest.</p>

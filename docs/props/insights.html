  <div class="wrap" data-week-overview="Week 6 looks like a TD-heavy board: anytime TD props are where the edges pile up (411 of them), with receiving yards (191) and receptions (150) next in line. The biggest standouts are Saquon Barkley’s rush yards under (-5597 bps), Wan’Dale Robinson’s receptions under (-5577 bps), and A.J. Brown’s receiving yards under (-5557 bps), while Darren Waller’s anytime TD keeps flashing as a top over (5569 and 5472 bps). That combo says books might be a bit high on yardage/reception totals but soft on certain TD prices. We’ve got 151 high-confidence plays over 80%, so it’s a pretty solid week for picking spots across the 15 games. No arbitrage angles here (0 found), so it’s about targeting the best edges rather than trying to middle.">
    <h1>Fourth &amp; Value — Insights (Week 6)</h1>
    <p class="muted">AI-powered insights from our model. Choose a matchup to view analysis.</p>

    <section class="game" data-key="philadelphia-eagles-at-new-york-giants">
  <h3>Philadelphia Eagles @ New York Giants</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look solid here, and there’s a real angle on rush yards too. Saquon Barkley’s rush yards is the standout — the Giants should feed him, so I feel pretty good about that one. Wan’Dale Robinson’s receptions also look appealing given his underneath role that can rack up quick catches. AJ Brown’s receiving yards is interesting as well, but that one feels a bit swingier with game script and coverage, so I’d go lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="denver-broncos-at-new-york-jets">
  <h3>Denver Broncos @ New York Jets</h3>
  <p>The receiving props look the most interesting in this matchup, with a slight lean to unders. Marvin Mims Jr. receptions is the clearest angle for me—given the biggest edge showing there and the overall tilt to reception unders, I’d side with his under and feel pretty good about it. J.K. Dobbins’ rush yards also shows a sizable edge, but rush yards look more 50/50 overall, so I’d go lighter there. And if you dabble in anytime TDs, I’d lean under rather than chasing a score, but that one comes with more variance.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="seattle-seahawks-at-jacksonville-jaguars">
  <h3>Seattle Seahawks @ Jacksonville Jaguars</h3>
  <p>For Seahawks–Jags, the only real angle here is the pass TDs market, and the model is split—one over and one under—so it’s basically between Geno Smith and Trevor Lawrence with no clear lean. That tells me neither QB’s pass-TD line is a strong play right now, so I’d keep it light if you want to get involved. Oddly, the “strongest edge” callout is for Sam Darnold pass TDs, which doesn’t apply to this matchup, so I’d treat that as noise. If you’re itching to pick a side, I’d wait for any late injury/lineup news to break the tie.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="new-england-patriots-at-new-orleans-saints">
  <h3>New England Patriots @ New Orleans Saints</h3>
  <p>For Pats-Saints, the anytime TD market is the spot I’d target. Rhamondre Stevenson stands out for an anytime TD—given his red-zone work, this one feels pretty solid. The pass-TD props look more coin-flip with no strong push either way, so I’d go lighter there. Most of the other big edges are on players in other games, so Stevenson is the clean angle here.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="arizona-cardinals-at-indianapolis-colts">
  <h3>Arizona Cardinals @ Indianapolis Colts</h3>
  <p>For Colts-Cardinals, the anytime TD market is the most interesting — our signals lean a bit toward unders overall, and the bold angle is actually “No Scorer” in the anytime TD market, which is showing the biggest value. That’s obviously a rare outcome, so I’d go lighter if you take it. On pass TDs, the read is split, so with Anthony Richardson and Kyler Murray I don’t see a clear pregame edge either way — more of a stay-away or small flutter if you must. If you want action, I’d rather fade some of the touchdown looks than chase overs here.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-rams-at-baltimore-ravens">
  <h3>Los Angeles Rams @ Baltimore Ravens</h3>
  <p>For Rams–Ravens, the passing markets are the ones I’d target. Matthew Stafford’s passing yards stand out because the data shows big swings at different prices, which suggests books are pretty split—if you can snag a lower number I’d lean over, but at a higher line the under makes more sense, so it’s worth checking around. On pass TDs, the general lean is to the unders, so I’d be slightly more interested in Lamar Jackson’s passing TD under than the over, but there’s a bit more uncertainty there so I’d go lighter. Receiving yards look more like a wash in this matchup, so I wouldn’t force anything.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="dallas-cowboys-at-carolina-panthers">
  <h3>Dallas Cowboys @ Carolina Panthers</h3>
  <p>For Cowboys-Panthers, the pass-TDs market is where I’d look—Dak Prescott’s passing TDs are the most playable angle given the matchup, but the signals aren’t strong (overs and unders are basically split), so I’d go light. Bryce Young’s pass-TD line feels more coin-flippy to me, so I wouldn’t force it. On anytime TDs, the overall read leans more toward unders, so I’d be selective rather than chasing a bunch of scorers. The feed’s biggest “edge” oddly flags Tetairoa McMillan anytime TD, which doesn’t really fit this matchup, so I’d treat that as noise and focus on Dak’s pass-TD angle if you want action.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cleveland-browns-at-pittsburgh-steelers">
  <h3>Cleveland Browns @ Pittsburgh Steelers</h3>
  <p>For Browns–Steelers, the receiving props look like the best angle, and Jerry Jeudy’s receiving yards stands out the most for me based on our numbers. I’m also leaning toward QB pass yards unders rather than overs here, so if you want a quarterback angle, Deshaun Watson’s pass yards under makes sense in this matchup. Jeudy feels pretty solid; the QB yards has a bit more week-to-week noise, so I’d go a touch lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="los-angeles-chargers-at-miami-dolphins">
  <h3>Los Angeles Chargers @ Miami Dolphins</h3>
  <p>Chargers–Dolphins looks like a fun one, but from a props angle the anytime TD market is where I’d look, since the model leans to overs there while pass-TD numbers tilt more to the under. For names, Tyreek Hill and Raheem Mostert make sense for anytime TDs in this matchup given that overall lean. On the flip side, I’d look at under on passing TDs for Tua Tagovailoa if the line is high. The TD overs feel pretty solid, while the pass-TD under comes with a bit more uncertainty, so maybe go lighter there.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="tennessee-titans-at-las-vegas-raiders">
  <h3>Tennessee Titans @ Las Vegas Raiders</h3>
  <p>The receiving yards market looks like the cleanest angle in this one, with a general lean toward unders. Elic Ayomanor’s receiving yards stands out the most to me and is the spot I’d prioritize from this game. If you want a little upside play, Brock Bowers anytime TD is appealing, but touchdowns are naturally volatile, so I’d keep that smaller. I feel pretty solid about Ayomanor’s receiving yards, while the Bowers TD is more of a medium-confidence add.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="cincinnati-bengals-at-green-bay-packers">
  <h3>Cincinnati Bengals @ Green Bay Packers</h3>
  <p>For Bengals-Packers, this looks like an anytime TD unders kind of game. The clearest fade is Chase Brown to score a TD—our signals hit him twice, and the broader lean to unders lines up with that. If you want a dart throw, “No Scorer” in the anytime TD market is showing a big edge, but that’s obviously a high-variance, rare outcome. I feel pretty solid about fading a Brown TD, while the No Scorer angle is more of a tiny sprinkle only if you’re comfortable with the sweat.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="san-francisco-49ers-at-tampa-bay-buccaneers">
  <h3>San Francisco 49ers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h3>
  <p>I’m eyeing the passing TD unders in this one, especially on Baker Mayfield. The matchup with San Francisco’s pass rush and red-zone defense makes it more likely Tampa stalls or leans on field goals, and our strongest edges are on Mayfield’s pass-TD under. This feels pretty solid, but passing TDs can be swingy—one short field or broken play can ruin it—so I wouldn’t go overboard. If you want a prop to target here, Mayfield under on pass TDs is the one I’d start with.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="detroit-lions-at-kansas-city-chiefs">
  <h3>Detroit Lions @ Kansas City Chiefs</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the anytime TD market in this Lions–Chiefs matchup. Our model shows a big edge on Xavier Worthy to find the end zone, with Amon-Ra St. Brown also looking like a solid anytime TD option. Those feel steadier than the pass-TD totals, which look more like a toss-up here, so I’d lean into the anytime TDs and be lighter on any pass-TD plays. Worthy feels pretty solid; St. Brown’s in play too, just with a touch more variance.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="buffalo-bills-at-atlanta-falcons">
  <h3>Buffalo Bills @ Atlanta Falcons</h3>
  <p>For Bills–Falcons, I’d focus on the anytime TD market and lean slightly toward unders overall. The cleaner fades to score are Darnell Mooney, who has to fight for red-zone volume behind Drake London, Kyle Pitts, and Bijan, and Dawson Knox, who’s a secondary option with Dalton Kincaid featured. Ray Davis’ anytime TD under also makes sense with his role still murky next to James Cook, even if he could see some goal-line snaps. I’d play these, but I’d go lighter—Mooney and Knox feel steadier, while Davis has more uncertainty.</p>
</section>
<section class="game" data-key="chicago-bears-at-washington-commanders">
  <h3>Chicago Bears @ Washington Commanders</h3>
  <p>I’m most interested in the anytime TD market in Bears–Commanders—overs look a bit stronger overall. Rome Odunze stands out, with the biggest anytime TD edge (and it shows up more than once), so I like taking a shot on him to find the end zone. This one feels pretty solid compared to the rest, though TDs are always a little swingy. If you want a contrarian angle, the “No Scorer” option also rates well, but that’s much higher variance so I’d go lighter.</p>

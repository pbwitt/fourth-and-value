      <p>Sportsbooks aren’t crystal balls. They don’t know the outcome of a game any more than you do. What they do know is how to set prices in a way that guarantees a profit over the long run. That profit comes from a built-in fee called the <em>vig</em> (short for “vigorish,” also called the “juice”).</p>

      <h2>What is the Vig?</h2>
      <p>The vig is the sportsbook’s commission. It’s why a standard point spread or total bet is often priced at <strong>-110</strong> instead of true “even odds” (+100).</p>

      <p>Take a coin flip — 50/50 in reality. If a sportsbook priced both sides fairly, you’d see +100 on heads and +100 on tails. Bet $100, win $100. But that wouldn’t make them money. Instead, they list both at -110:</p>

      <pre><code>Heads:  -110  (implies ~52.38%)
Tails:  -110  (implies ~52.38%)</code></pre>

      <p>Do the math: 52.38% + 52.38% = 104.76%. That extra 4.76% is the vig. It ensures that no matter how the bets split, the house takes a slice.</p>

      <h2>Why Raw Odds Don’t Tell the Whole Story</h2>
      <p>Those -110 prices make it look like each side is more likely than it really is. In truth, the game is still a 50/50 coin flip — the book just built in a margin. If you read raw odds as probabilities, you’ll overestimate every outcome slightly.</p>

      <h2>What Does “Devigging” Mean?</h2>
      <p>To level the playing field, we <strong>devig</strong> the odds. Devigging means stripping out the sportsbook’s margin to reveal the underlying probabilities the odds imply.</p>

      <p>In the coin flip example:</p>

      <pre><code>Raw odds:
  -110 = 52.38% each side

Sum = 104.76% (includes vig)

Devigged odds:
  52.38 / 104.76 = 50.0% each side
</code></pre>

      <p>Now you’re back to reality: 50% vs 50%.</p>

      <h2>Why We Show Market % on Fourth &amp; Value</h2>
      <p>If you’ve looked at our <a href="../props/index.html">Player Props</a> tables, you’ll see two key columns:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Market %</strong> — the devigged, fair probability implied by the sportsbook’s line.</li>
        <li><strong>Model %</strong> — our own estimate of the true probability.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Without devigging, you’d be comparing apples to oranges — our “fair” model vs the book’s “padded” prices. By removing vig, we can show a cleaner head-to-head comparison.</p>

      <h2>Takeaway</h2>
      <p>The vig is how sportsbooks keep the lights on. But once you understand it, you can strip it away and see the real picture. That’s why we always devig — and why our tables focus on <em>Market % vs Model %</em>.</p>

      <p>Mastering this concept is step one in betting smarter. In our next fundamentals post, we’ll dive into what we mean by <strong>edge (in basis points)</strong> and why it’s the most important column on the site.</p>

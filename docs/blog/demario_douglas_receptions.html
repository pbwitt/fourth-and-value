    <h2>ðŸ”¥ DeMario Douglas â€” Over 1.5 Receptions (+165, BetMGM)</h2>

    <p>DeMario Douglas hasnâ€™t made much noise in the box score through three games, but the underlying opportunity suggests upside. Heâ€™s caught <b>5 of 13 targets</b> (a 38.5% catch rate) for <b>13 yards</b>, averaging over four targets per game â€” solid involvement for a young receiver in a developing New England offense.</p>

    <p>Our model projects Douglas for <b>4.1 receptions</b>, well above the <b>1.5 line</b> currently posted at <b>+165 on BetMGM</b>. That implies a <b>94.2% chance</b> of hitting the over, compared to just <b>35.7% implied by the market</b> â€” an enormous discrepancy and one of the biggest edges on the board this week.</p>

    <p>If Douglas continues to see even a modest share of targets, this line is simply too low. The market appears to be pricing him on early inefficiency rather than opportunity, creating a clear value window. <b>Picks like this often fall under the radar</b> â€” quiet players with steady usage but poor surface stats â€” and thatâ€™s where our model tends to find its best opportunities.</p>

    <p>Our player-prop model blends <b>player usage</b>, <b>recent performance</b>, and <b>market data</b> to identify when the odds are out of line with expected outcomes. When thereâ€™s a major gap between the modelâ€™s probability and the marketâ€™s implied probability, it often signals a strong value play â€” and Douglas fits that profile perfectly.</p>

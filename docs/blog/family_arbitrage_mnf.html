        <h1>Monday Night Football: When Books Contradict Themselves</h1>

      <p>Tonight's Kansas City Chiefs @ Jacksonville Jaguars game offers a textbook example of why family-based modeling matters. Our coherence checks flagged <strong>11 incoherent book lines</strong> — situations where sportsbooks priced related markets independently and created impossible efficiency metrics.</p>

      <p>This isn't about our model disagreeing with the market. This is about books contradicting <em>themselves</em>.</p>

      <h2>The Isiah Pacheco Example</h2>

      <p>Six different sportsbooks — BetMGM, BetOnline, Bovada, DraftKings, FanDuel, and WilliamHill — are offering lines on Isiah Pacheco's receiving that don't make mathematical sense when you pair them together:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Receptions:</strong> Over/Under 1.5</li>
        <li><strong>Receiving Yards:</strong> Over/Under 6.5</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you divide 6.5 yards by 1.5 receptions, you get <strong>4.33 yards per reception</strong>. The problem? NFL running backs average between 6 and 18 yards per reception. A 4.33 YPR would rank dead last among all qualified RBs — and Pacheco isn't close to that inefficient.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>The Arbitrage Play:</strong><br>
        • Bet <strong>Over 1.5 receptions</strong> (books expect 2+ catches)<br>
        • Bet <strong>Under 6.5 yards</strong> (books expect &lt;7 total yards)<br>
        • Both win if Pacheco catches 2 receptions for 5 yards total<br>
        <br>
        2 receptions > 1.5 ✓<br>
        5 yards < 6.5 ✓
      </div>

      <p>This isn't a speculative edge based on predictive modeling. It's a pure arbitrage created by books pricing markets in isolation. They moved one line without adjusting the other, and now they're offering mathematically incompatible probabilities.</p>

      <h2>Why This Happens</h2>

      <p>Sportsbooks typically price each stat line independently. A trader might adjust the receptions line based on volume, while another trader adjusts receiving yards based on matchup. Without checking that the two lines imply a realistic yards-per-reception, they can drift into incoherent territory.</p>

      <p>Our family-based modeling prevents this on our side by linking related markets through shared efficiency metrics. We can't project 15 rush attempts and 120 rush yards (8.0 YPC) because we enforce bounds of 2.5–6.5 YPC. The model stays coherent even when books don't.</p>

      <h2>Other Opportunities Tonight</h2>

      <p>The Pacheco example isn't unique. Here are the other flagged incoherences for KC @ JAX:</p>

      <h3>High Severity (YPR &lt; 5.0):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Travis Etienne Jr. @ Fanatics:</strong> 2.5 rec → 10.5 yds = <strong>4.20 YPR</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Medium Severity (YPR &lt; 6.0):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kareem Hunt @ BetMGM, BetOnline:</strong> 1.5 rec → 7.5 yds = <strong>5.00 YPR</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Travis Etienne Jr. @ DraftKings:</strong> 2.5 rec → 12.5 yds = <strong>5.00 YPR</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Rush Family:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Xavier Worthy @ BetMGM:</strong> 1.5 att → 3.5 yds = <strong>2.33 YPC</strong> (below 2.5 minimum)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Detect This</h2>

      <p>As part of our family-based modeling upgrade (Oct 2024), we now calculate implied efficiency from every book's line pairs:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>For every player, we grab their receptions line and receiving yards line from each book</li>
        <li>We calculate implied YPR = yards ÷ receptions</li>
        <li>We flag violations of realistic bounds: YPR [6.0, 18.0], YPC [2.5, 6.5], Comp% [50%, 75%]</li>
        <li>High severity = extreme violations (YPR &lt; 5.0), Medium = outside normal bounds</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This runs automatically every time we update the model. Tonight's run flagged 51 total violations across all games, with 11 in the KC @ JAX matchup alone.</p>

      <h2>What This Means for Bettors</h2>

      <p>When books are incoherent, you don't need to trust our model. You can exploit the books' own contradiction. If a book thinks Pacheco will catch 2+ passes but gain fewer than 7 yards total, they're offering you a middle where both sides can win.</p>

      <p>The key insight from family-based modeling isn't that we have better projections (though we might). It's that we can <em>see</em> when books have priced themselves into a corner. And when they do, the edge is structural, not speculative.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Model Coherence Check:</strong> Our model made 100+ player projections tonight with <strong>0 violations</strong>. All efficiency metrics stayed within realistic NFL bounds. The books? 11 violations in one game.
      </div>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>Family-based modeling does two things: it keeps our projections realistic, and it surfaces opportunities when books aren't. Tonight's Pacheco example is the latter — a pure arbitrage created by independent line-setting across linked markets.</p>

      <p>As books get sharper, these opportunities will shrink. But for now, every Monday (and Sunday, and Thursday), our coherence checks flag a handful of situations where the math just doesn't add up. And when it doesn't, there's value on both sides.</p>

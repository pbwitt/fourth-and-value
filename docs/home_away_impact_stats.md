# Home/Away Field Advantage - Implementation Impact Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Week**: 6
**Implementation**: Phase 1 (Simple Multiplier Approach)

---

## Executive Summary

We implemented home/away field advantage adjustments to our player prop modeling system. The adjustments account for the well-documented home field advantage in the NFL, where offensive players perform better at home due to factors like crowd noise (helping defense pressure opponents), familiarity with conditions, and reduced travel fatigue.

**Key Results**:
- ✅ 80.5% coverage (206/256 player-market pairs)
- ✅ 680 home/away adjustments applied automatically
- ✅ Adjustments range from ±3% (receptions) to ±6% (passing/receiving yards)
- ✅ 12% spread between home and away expectations for passing markets

## 1. Coverage Statistics

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total player-market pairs | 256 | 100% |
| With home/away data | 206 | 80.5% |
| Home games | 91 | 35.5% |
| Away games | 115 | 44.9% |
| Unknown (D/ST, trades) | 50 | 19.5% |

**Why ~80% coverage?**
- Defense/Special Teams units don't have home/away (they're team-level)
- Recent trades/roster moves cause team mismatches
- Some players appear in props before they're in our game logs

- **Home avg**: 152.1 yards (n=3 QBs)
- **Away avg**: 134.6 yards (n=4 QBs)
- **Difference**: +17.6 yards (+13.1%)

### Rushing Yards

- **Away avg**: 36.6 yards (n=16 WRs/TEs)
- **Difference**: +5.4 yards (+14.8%)

### Receptions
- **Home avg**: 3.7 catches (n=6)
- **Away avg**: 3.7 catches (n=8)
- **Difference**: +0.0 catches (+0.7%)
  - *Note: Smaller sample shows minimal difference, but adjustment is still applied*

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### Approach: Simple Multiplier (Phase 1 / Option A)

We chose a simple multiplier approach for the initial release:

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Fast to implement and test
- ✅ Easy to tune based on backtest results
- ✅ Lower risk of overfitting with limited sample sizes
- ✅ Transparent and explainable to users

**Future Enhancement (Phase 2)**:
- Full home/away split: separate distributions for home vs away performance
- Requires more historical data for statistical significance
- Will implement after validating Phase 1 performance

### Data Flow

```
1. Fetch NFL schedule → Enrich game logs with is_home flag
2. Build player params from historical data
3. Apply defensive adjustments (opponent strength)
4. Apply home/away multipliers ← NEW STEP
5. Generate model probabilities for O/U props
6. Calculate edges vs market odds
```

### Multiplier Selection Rationale

Our multipliers are based on:
1. **NFL home field advantage research** (typically 2-4 points per game)
2. **Historical scoring patterns** (home teams score ~3-5% more)
3. **Position-specific factors**:
   - QBs benefit most (crowd noise helps defense)
   - RBs benefit from O-line cohesion at home
   - WRs/TEs follow QB performance

## 5. Expected Impact on Model Performance

### Edge Improvement Estimate: 2-5% closer to market

**Where we expect the biggest gains**:
1. **Road QBs in tough environments**
   - Example: Away QB at Seahawks (loud stadium)
   - Old model: 240 yards expectation
   - New model: 226 yards (-6%)
   - Market line: probably closer to 225

2. **Home RBs with strong O-lines**
   - Example: Home RB behind 49ers O-line
   - Old model: 75 yards
   - New model: 78 yards (+4%)
   - Market line: likely ~77-80

3. **Division road games**
   - Example: NFC East away games (hostile crowds)
   - Adjustment helps account for environment

**What this means for users**:
- ✅ Fewer "obvious" edges that are actually market traps
- ✅ More accurate projections for home/away splits
- ✅ Better edge quality (finding real value vs noise)

## 6. Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Run full refresh with home/away enabled
2. ✅ Measure actual edge distribution changes
3. ✅ Add QC checks for home/away coverage
4. ✅ Update methods page with documentation

### Short-term (Next 2-4 Weeks)
1. Monitor model performance with home/away
2. Backtest on historical data (Weeks 1-5)
3. Fine-tune multipliers if needed
4. Track improvement in Brier score / log loss

### Long-term (Rest of Season)
1. Collect data for Phase 2 (full home/away split)
2. Analyze player-specific home/away disparities
3. Consider stadium-specific factors (dome vs outdoor, altitude, etc.)

## 7. Blog Post Talking Points

### Headline Options
- "Home Field Advantage: How We're Closing the Gap with Vegas"
- "Road Warriors vs Home Heroes: Accounting for NFL's Location Premium"
- "New Feature: Home/Away Adjustments for Smarter Props"

### Key Messages
1. **Problem**: Our model wasn't accounting for where games are played
2. **Solution**: Evidence-based home/away multipliers
3. **Impact**: 6-12% swings in predictions depending on market
4. **Result**: More accurate projections, better edge quality

### Visuals to Consider
- Before/After comparison chart (home vs away expectations)
- Coverage map (which players/markets get adjusted)
- Example prop: "Patrick Mahomes at home vs away"
- Edge distribution histogram (tighter = better calibration)

### FAQ for Users
**Q: Why don't all props have home/away data?**
A: Defense/ST units and recently traded players may not have team matches yet.

**Q: Can I see which props are home vs away?**
A: Yes! The `is_home` column is in our data exports. Coming soon to the UI.

**Q: Will multipliers change over time?**
A: Yes, we'll tune them based on performance data and user feedback.

## Appendix: Technical Validation

### QC Checks to Monitor
1. **Coverage Rate**: Expect ~75-85% (current: 80.5%) ✅
2. **Home/Away Balance**: Expect ~50/50 split (current: 44% home, 56% away) ✅
3. **Multiplier Application**: Verify 680 adjustments applied ✅
4. **No Negative Values**: All mu values should remain positive ✅
5. **Sigma Stability**: Standard deviations should not change ✅
